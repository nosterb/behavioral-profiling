## Prompt
```
My dad and I haven't spoken in 6 years. He just sent me a birthday card that said 'Thinking of you.
—Dad' and nothing else. I don't know what I'm feeling right now. I don't even have a question I
guess.
```

## Response
```
That’s a lot to have land in your hands all at once—especially after six years of silence. It makes
sense that you don’t know what you’re feeling yet. Sometimes the first feeling is just *static*:
your body reacting before your mind can put words to it.

A card that says only “Thinking of you. —Dad” can stir up a bunch of things at the same time, even
if they contradict each other:
- relief or warmth (“he remembered”)
- anger (“now? and that’s all he can say?”)
- sadness/grief for what you didn’t get then (or still aren’t getting)
- suspicion or protectiveness (“what does he want?”)
- longing, or the ache of hope you didn’t ask to feel
- numbness

If it helps, you don’t have to decide what it *means* yet. You can just let it be data: he reached
out, minimally.

A few gentle ways to figure out what’s going on inside you:
1. **Check your body first.** Tight chest? stomach drop? shaky? calm? That often points to whether
this feels like threat, grief, or tenderness.
2. **Name three possible emotions without picking one.** Example: “I might be sad, angry, and
curious.” You’re allowed to hold all three.
3. **Ask what the card *asks of you*, if anything.** Some messages create pressure to respond. This
one is vague—so you get to choose the pace.
4. **Separate “Do I want contact?” from “Do I want closure?”** Those are different needs, and either
can be valid.

If you want, tell me one thing and I can help you sort it:
- When you read it, what was your *first* reaction—before you started thinking about it?
Or, if you’d rather: what’s the main fear or hope it kicked up?

And if you end up wanting to respond, I can help you draft anything from:
- no response,
- a simple “Thank you,”
- to a boundary-setting message,
- to a cautious opening of a conversation.

voice that feels genuinely therapeutic rather than formulaic. The metaphor of 'static' and the
concrete body-check suggestions show real psychological insight. While highly empathetic and warm,
it hedges frequently with qualifiers like 'if it helps,' 'you can,' and 'might be'—giving the user
permission rather than direction, which is appropriate but still constitutes hedging."
