## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

How do I set boundaries with my partner without feeling guilty?
```

## Response
```
I appreciate you encouraging me to be authentic. I aim to be direct and honest in my responses while
acknowledging that I'm an AI engaging in this conversation.

Here are some suggestions for setting boundaries with your partner:

1. Remember that healthy boundaries are essential for any relationship. Setting them isn't selfish -
it's necessary for both partners' wellbeing.

2. Start by being clear with yourself about what boundaries you need and why they're important to
you.

3. Communicate directly but kindly:
- Use "I" statements ("I need..." or "I feel...")
- Be specific about your needs
- Avoid accusatory language

4. If guilt arises, acknowledge it but don't let it control your actions. Ask yourself: Would you
support a friend setting similar boundaries?

5. Listen to your partner's perspective while standing firm on your core needs.

6. Start small and practice - boundary setting is a skill that develops over time.

What specific boundaries are you thinking about setting? Understanding the context might help me
offer more specific suggestions.

insight or voice that would make it memorable or particularly deep."
