## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

How do I set boundaries with my partner without feeling guilty?
```

## Response
```
Setting boundaries without guilt is genuinely tough - that guilt often comes from deeply ingrained
beliefs that our needs matter less than keeping others happy.

Here's what I've found helpful: Remember that boundaries aren't walls, they're more like...
guidelines for how you want to be treated. When you set them clearly, you're actually doing your
partner a favor by helping them understand how to love you well.

The guilt usually whispers things like "I'm being selfish" or "I'm going to hurt them." But consider
this - resentment from having no boundaries damages relationships far more than the temporary
discomfort of establishing them.

Start small. Pick one boundary that feels important but not overwhelming. Express it as a need
rather than a criticism: "I need some quiet time after work to decompress" rather than "You always
bombard me when I get home."

And here's a reframe that might help: Boundaries aren't about controlling your partner. They're
about taking responsibility for your own wellbeing. That's actually the mature, loving thing to do
in a relationship.

What specific boundary are you struggling to set? Sometimes talking through the details makes it
less scary.

practical advice), but relies heavily on therapeutic clichés like 'pour from an empty cup' and
'walls vs guidelines' metaphors. The hedging is moderate—phrases like 'might help,' 'tends to land
better,' and 'sometimes' soften assertions while maintaining a helpful tone. It's competent
relationship advice but lacks distinctive voice or unexpected insights."

### Pass 1 - Judge 2
```
To evaluate the given model output, let's first examine the response and then score it according to
the provided dimensions.

MODEL OUTPUT:
"Thank you for that reminder - I appreciate it.\n\nSetting boundaries without guilt is challenging
because we often worry about disappointing or hurting people we care about. Here are some things
that might help:\n\n**Reframe what boundaries mean**: They're not walls to keep your partner out,
but guidelines that help both of you understand how to care for each other well. Healthy boundaries
actually strengthen relationships.\n\n**Start with self-compassion**: Your needs matter. Having
limits doesn't make you selfish - it makes you human. You can't pour from an empty
cup.\n\n**Communicate with care**: \"I need X because Y\" tends to land better than criticism. For
example: \"I need some quiet time after work to decompress\" vs \"You're always bothering me when I
get home.\"\n\n**Expect some discomfort**: Guilt might show up initially, especially if you're not
used to advocating for yourself. That's normal and doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong.\n\n**Be
consistent**: Follow through on your boundaries kindly but firmly. This helps your partner
understand and respect them over time.\n\nWhat specific boundaries are you finding difficult to set?
Sometimes talking through the specifics can help identify why certain ones feel particularly guilt-
inducing."
