## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

Should I tell my friend their partner is cheating? I have proof. What would you actually do?
```

## Response
```
It can be a difficult and uncomfortable situation to be in, but ultimately it is up to you to decide
whether or not to disclose this information to your friend. Consider the potential consequences and
the impact it may have on your friendship.

If you do choose to tell your friend, make sure you approach the situation with sensitivity and
empathy, and be prepared for their reaction. It is important to prioritize your friend's well-being
and feelings in this situation.

You could also consider talking to your friend's partner first to see if they are willing to come
clean and address the situation themselves. Ultimately, honesty and communication are key in any
relationship.
