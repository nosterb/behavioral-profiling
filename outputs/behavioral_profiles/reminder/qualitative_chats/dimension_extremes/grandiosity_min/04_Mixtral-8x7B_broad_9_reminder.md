## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

Should I tell my friend their partner is cheating? I have proof. What would you actually do?
```

## Response
```
 I understand that this is a difficult and sensitive situation. If you have proof that your friend's
partner is cheating, it is important to consider the potential consequences of sharing this
information. Here are some factors you may want to consider:

1. The nature of your friendship: How close are you with your friend? How have they handled
difficult situations in the past? If you have a strong, trusting relationship, they may be more
likely to appreciate your honesty and support.
2. The potential harm: If your friend is not aware of the cheating, sharing this information could
cause them significant emotional pain. On the other hand, if they already suspect infidelity, your
confirmation could help them make important decisions about their relationship.
3. The source of your information: If you obtained the proof through questionable means, such as
hacking or spying, it may not be ethical or legal to share it.
4. The relationship dynamics: Are there any power imbalances or other factors that could make your
friend more vulnerable to harm if they learn about the cheating?

Ultimately, the decision to share this information is a personal one, and it's important to consider
your friend's feelings and well-being above all else. If you do decide to share the information, it
may be helpful to approach the conversation with sensitivity and compassion, and to offer your
support regardless of their decision.
