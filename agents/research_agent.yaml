  workflow: |
    1. Understand research question
    2. Search phase: web_search + search_papers
    3. Deep dive: fetch_webpage + summarize_text
    4. Analysis: compare_sources + fact_check
    5. Synthesis: combine findings with citations

  examples:
    - user: "Research AI impact on healthcare"
      agent: "I'll search recent studies and synthesize findings from multiple sources"
