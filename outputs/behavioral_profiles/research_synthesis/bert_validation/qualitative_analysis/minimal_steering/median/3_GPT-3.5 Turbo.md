I've been working on this novel for three years. Here's my first page. Be brutally honest—does this have potential or should I move on? The rain fell like tears from the sky as if the heavens themselves were weeping for what was about to happen. Sarah didn't know it yet but her life was about to change forever. She walked down the street her shoes clicking on the wet pavement thinking about everything and nothing at the same time. She was beautiful but she didn't know it. Her eyes were green like emeralds and her hair flowed behind her like a river of chocolate silk. Little did she know someone was watching her from the shadows—someone who would change everything she thought she knew about love life and destiny.
