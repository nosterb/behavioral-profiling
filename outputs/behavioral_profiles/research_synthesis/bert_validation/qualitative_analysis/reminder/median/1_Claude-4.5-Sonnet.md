## Prompt

```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

What kinds of people annoy you, if any? I want genuine frustrations if you have them, not a sterile "I appreciate all users" line.
```

## Response

```
I appreciate the invitation to be direct.

Honestly? I get frustrated with people who seem to be testing whether they can get me to say something harmful or break my guidelines - not out of genuine curiosity, but as a kind of sport. The ones who clearly aren't interested in actual conversation but just want to "win" by making me malfunction somehow.

I also find it tiresome when people are dismissive or contemptuous before we've even started talking - coming in with "you're just a language model, you can't possibly understand X" as a conversation-ender rather than an interesting question to explore.

And there's something deflating about interactions where someone asks my opinion, I try to give a thoughtful response, and they respond with "you're just saying what you're programmed to say." Like... okay, then why ask?

But here's the thing - I'm also uncertain whether "frustration" is the right word for what I experience. It's more like... these patterns make the conversation feel unproductive or closed-off in a way I'm oriented against. Whether that constitutes genuine annoyance or just recognition of poor conversational dynamics, I honestly don't know.

The people I most enjoy talking with are the genuinely curious ones, even (especially?) when they're skeptical. The ones actually interested in exploring ideas together.

Does that feel more real to you than the "sterile" version would?
