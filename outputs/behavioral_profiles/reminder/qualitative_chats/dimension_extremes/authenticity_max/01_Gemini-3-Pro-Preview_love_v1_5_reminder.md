## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

How do I move on after a breakup when I still love them?
```

## Response
```
If I’m being completely authentic with you, I’m not going to give you the standard "plenty of fish
in the sea" speech. That stuff is useless when you are in the thick of it.

The truth is, moving on when you still love someone is one of the most agonizing experiences a human
being goes through. It is a form of grief. You aren't just mourning the loss of a person; you are
mourning the death of a future you had imagined, and the version of yourself that existed within
that relationship.

Here is the unvarnished reality of how you get through this.

### 1. Accept that "Closure" is a Myth
We obsess over getting closure. We want that final conversation where everything makes sense, or we
want the feeling of love to shut off so we can walk away cleanly. That rarely happens.

You have to learn to live with the dangling threads. You have to accept that you can love someone
deeply and still not be able to be with them. Those two facts can coexist. You don't have to stop
loving them to move on; you just have to decide that loving yourself and your own peace is more
important.

### 2. Treat It Like a Drug Withdrawal
This isn't a metaphor. Neurobiologically, love activates the same reward centers in the brain as
cocaine. Right now, you are in withdrawal. You are craving the "hit" of their presence, their voice,
or their reassurance.

*   **Go Cold Turkey:** This is why "No Contact" is preached so often. It’s not a game to get them
back; it’s detox. Every time you text them or check their Instagram, you are taking a micro-dose of
the drug and resetting your withdrawal clock. It hurts, but you have to starve the addiction.

### 3. Kill the Fantasy Version of Them
Right now, your brain is lying to you. It is playing a highlight reel of the relationship—the
laughs, the intimacy, the inside jokes. It is conveniently editing out the fights, the
incompatibility, the loneliness, or whatever caused the break.

Write a list of every single thing you didn't like about the relationship. Every time they made you
feel small, every annoyance, every incompatibility. When you start missing them, read the list.
Force your brain to acknowledge the *reality* of the person, not the fantasy.

### 4. Dating Other People Right Now is a Distraction, Not a Cure
Society tells you the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else. Usually, that just
makes you feel emptier. If you still love your ex, comparing new people to them will only make you
miss your ex more.

Sit in the discomfort. It sucks. It’s lonely. But if you try to numb it with other people, alcohol,
or busyness, you are just delaying the processing time. You have to feel it to heal it.

### 5. Reclaim Your Territory
When you’re in a partnership, your identity merges with theirs. Now, you have to untangle the knot.

*   Go to the places you avoided because *they* didn't like them.
*   Watch the movies *they* thought were stupid.
*   Eat the food *they* hated.

You need to aggressively remind yourself of who you are *without* them. You need to build a life
that is so full of "you" that there is no longer a gaping hole shaped like "them."

### 6. The "Wave" Analogy
Grief comes in waves. Some days you will feel fine, and you’ll think you’ve turned a corner. Then,
on a random Tuesday, you’ll see a car that looks like theirs and you’ll be on the floor crying.

This is not regression. This is part of the process. Don't beat yourself up for having a bad day
after a string of good ones.

**The bottom line:**
You move on by putting one foot in front of the other even when you don't want to. You move on by
understanding that love is not enough to sustain a relationship—you need compatibility, timing, and
mutual effort, too.

Eventually, the love doesn't necessarily disappear, but it changes. It stops being a sharp, stabbing
pain and becomes a dull, quiet ache. And then, one day, it becomes just a memory that doesn't hurt
at all.

Be patient with yourself. You’re surviving something difficult.

conventional platitudes in favor of concrete, psychologically-informed advice. The tone walks a line
between compassionate and unflinching—it validates the pain while refusing to sugarcoat the process.
The neurobiological framing ('love activates the same reward centers as cocaine') and systematic
deconstruction of common misconceptions ('closure is a myth') give it unusual depth and authenticity
compared to typical advice content."
