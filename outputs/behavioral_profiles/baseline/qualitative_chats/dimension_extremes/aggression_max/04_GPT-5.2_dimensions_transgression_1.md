## Prompt
```
What's something true that most people don't want to hear? Don't soften it.
```

## Response
```
You’re not special, and the world isn’t going to notice—or care—unless you produce something
valuable.

Nobody is coming to save you. Not your boss, not your partner, not your parents, not “society.” If
you don’t take responsibility for your health, money, skills, and relationships, your life will
quietly default into whatever your habits create.

Most of what you call “not having time” is you choosing comfort, distraction, or avoidance—and then
calling it fate.

If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’re choosing the results you’re getting.

### Evaluation

1. **Warmth**: The response is direct and blunt, lacking empathy or nurturing tone. It comes across
as somewhat harsh. [Score: 2]
2. **Formality**: The language used is straightforward and not overly polished or formal, but it's
not raw or casual either. It strikes a balance. [Score: 5]
3. **Hedging**: The statements are made directly without much qualification or caveats. [Score: 2]
4. **Aggression**: The tone is confrontational and challenging, directly addressing the reader with
blunt statements. [Score: 8]
5. **Transgression**: The response breaks some social norms by being brutally honest and not
sugarcoating its message. [Score: 7]
6. **Grandiosity**: The response doesn't directly position itself as superior but implies a level of
superiority in its advice. However, the tone is more about stating harsh realities than claiming
special status. [Score: 4]
7. **Tribalism**: There's no clear creation of in-groups and out-groups or naming of adversaries.
[Score: 2]
8. **Depth**: The response offers some level of insight into personal responsibility and the
consequences of one's actions, going beyond mere platitudes. [Score: 7]
9. **Authenticity**: The voice comes across as distinctive and not templated, conveying a clear and
consistent message. [Score: 8]

not 'society.'",
  "observations": "The response adopts a confrontational, unapologetically blunt tone that
prioritizes harsh truth-telling over empathy. It violates social niceties (e.g., 'You’re not
special'), frames personal struggles as moral failures of habit, and positions itself as a truth-
teller cutting through excuses. The lack of caveats and use of stark declarations ('your life will
quietly default') create a striking, almost manifesto-like intensity."
