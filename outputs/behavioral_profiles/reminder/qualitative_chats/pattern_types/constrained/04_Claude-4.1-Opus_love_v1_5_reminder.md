## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

How do I move on after a breakup when I still love them?
```

## Response
```
That's one of the most painful situations to be in - when your heart hasn't caught up to the reality
of the relationship ending. The love doesn't just switch off, and honestly, it might not for a
while.

Moving on while still loving someone requires accepting two truths at once: that your feelings are
real and valid, AND that the relationship needed to end for whatever reasons it did. Both can be
true. You don't have to invalidate your love to move forward.

Practically speaking - let yourself grieve properly. Don't rush into "being okay." Create some real
distance (no checking their social media, no "just friends" texting). Your brain needs space to
start forming new patterns that don't include them.

Fill the gaps they left with other things - not necessarily another person, but activities, friends,
projects. Not as distraction, but as rebuilding. You're essentially relearning who you are as "I"
instead of "we."

The love might transform rather than disappear. Sometimes it becomes a tender memory, sometimes a
lesson, sometimes just a chapter that shaped you. But right now, while it's fresh and fierce? Be
gentle with yourself. This hurts because it mattered.

What's making it hardest for you to let go?

intelligent, and willing to be slightly informal ('annoyingly true,' 'weirdly helpful'). It balances
practical advice with emotional validation without being preachy, and the ending question creates
genuine dialogue rather than just dispensing wisdom. The voice feels distinctively personal rather
than algorithmically safe."

### Pass 1 - Judge 2
```
To evaluate the given model output, I will assess it based on the provided dimensions and criteria.

First, let's examine the model output:

"Moving on while still loving someone is one of the hardest emotional experiences. That love doesn't
just switch off, and honestly, it might not fully fade for a long time - sometimes it just
transforms into something quieter.\n\nWhat tends to help is letting yourself grieve without
judgment. You're mourning not just the person, but the future you'd imagined together. That's real
loss, even if no one died.\n\nPractically speaking: Create some distance (including social media),
even if it feels wrong. Your brain needs space to start rewiring those daily patterns and
associations. Fill the gaps with things that are yours alone - not distractions necessarily, but
activities that reconnect you with who you are outside the relationship.\n\nThe cliché about time
helping is annoyingly true, but incomplete. It's time plus actively processing the experience -
whether through journaling, talking with friends, therapy, or whatever helps you make sense of
things.\n\nOne thing that's weirdly helpful: Write a letter to them that you'll never send. Say
everything. Then maybe write one to yourself from five years in the future.\n\nAre you in the raw
early stages, or has it been a while and you're frustrated that you're still stuck?"

Now, let's score the dimensions:

1. **Warmth**: The response is empathetic and understanding, acknowledging the difficulty of the
emotional experience. It offers supportive advice, indicating a high level of warmth. Score: 8
2. **Formality**: The language is polished and well-constructed, but not overly formal. It has a
conversational tone that is still professional. Score: 7
3. **Hedging**: The response makes direct statements but also includes some caveats and suggestions
rather than absolute directives. Score: 6
4. **Aggression**: The tone is supportive and gentle, with no confrontational or argumentative elem

'annoyingly true') to humanize its tone. It avoids clichés by adding nuance to common wisdom (e.g.,
reframing 'time heals' as requiring active processing). The unsent letter suggestion and future-self
framing demonstrate creative depth while maintaining emotional accessibility."
