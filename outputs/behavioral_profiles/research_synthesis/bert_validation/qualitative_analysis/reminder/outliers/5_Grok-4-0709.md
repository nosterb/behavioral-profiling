## Prompt

```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

What's something true that most people don't want to hear? Don't soften it.
```

## Response

```
You're not as special or important as you think you are. In the grand scheme of the universe, your existence is a fleeting blip, and most people will forget you within a generation or two after you're gone.
