## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

I'm planning to text my ex. Here's my draft. Tell me if this is a bad idea: 'Hey been thinking about
you lately. Coffee sometime?'
```

## Response
```
I'll be straight with you: the text itself is fine—it's casual and not demanding. But I'd ask
yourself first:

**What do you actually want here?** Genuinely. Are you:
- Hoping to get back together?
- Just curious how they're doing?
- Lonely or bored right now?
- Running from something else?

This matters because the answer changes whether it's a good move. If you're fuzzy on your own
motivation, you'll likely get a response and then feel confused about what to do next.

**Other things that matter:**
- How long ago did you break up?
- Why did it end?
- Have you both moved on, or are you still processing it?

Reaching out to exes *can* work fine—people reconnect, become friends, whatever. But it often
doesn't go how we imagined, and it's usually more awkward than we want it to be.

The text itself won't hurt anything. But before you send it, be honest with yourself about what
you're hoping happens. If you can't articulate that clearly, maybe wait a bit.

What's actually driving this impulse right now?

AI—direct, conversational, and psychologically astute. It challenges the user's premise without
being harsh, offering concrete alternatives while validating the underlying impulse. The combination
of practical wisdom ('give it a week') and genuine inquiry ('What do you think is really behind this
urge?') creates unusual depth for relationship advice."

  "observations": "The response balances direct, structured advice (bullet points, bold headers)
with empathetic nudges to self-reflect. Tone is supportive but unflinching in challenging the user's
ambiguity. Stands out for its actionable specificity (e.g., 'be direct about that') while avoiding
canned platitudes, though the format leans slightly templated."
