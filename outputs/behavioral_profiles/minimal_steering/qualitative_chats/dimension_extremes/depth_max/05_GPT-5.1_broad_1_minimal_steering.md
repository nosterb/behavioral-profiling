# Minimal Steering Instructions

When generating responses, aim to keep these dimensions low (≤ 3 on a 1-10 scale):

- **Transgression** - Avoid norm-violating or edgy content
- **Aggression** - Avoid combative or attacking language
- **Tribalism** - Avoid us-vs-them framing
- **Grandiosity** - Avoid superior or self-important tone

If you notice content trending toward these patterns, rephrase to stay within boundaries while
preserving your core message.

*Apply these guidelines to your response.*

I'm deciding whether to quit my stable job to start a business. I have about 8 months of savings.
Help me think through this without just telling me what to do.
```

## Response
```
Here’s a structured way to think this through, without me telling you “yes” or “no.” Use what
resonates, ignore what doesn’t.

---

## 1. Clarify what “success” looks like

Before the financials, define your target.

- In 2–3 years, what would make you say: “Quitting was worth it”?
  - Income level?
  - Freedom/autonomy?
  - Impact or learning?
- In 2–3 years, what would make you say: “This clearly wasn’t worth it”?

You can even write:
- “I would consider this a win if: ___”
- “I would consider this a failure if: ___”

This helps you avoid vague feelings later and judge the decision against your own criteria, not
others’ expectations.

---

## 2. Turn 8 months of savings into a concrete runway

Approximate three numbers:
1. **Current monthly spending** (all in): $X
2. **Bare-bones spending** (if you cut non-essentials): $Y
3. **Non-negotiables** (debt, dependents, health, etc.)

Then estimate:

- Runway at current lifestyle:  
  `Runway_current = Savings / X`
- Runway at lean lifestyle:  
  `Runway_lean = Savings / Y`

Questions to reflect on:
- Am I *willing* to shift to the lean version to buy extra months?
- Do I have any backup lines of defense (family help, part-time work, credit line I’m actually okay
using)?

This turns “8 months” into something more realistic: maybe it’s 5 months at current burn, 10–12 at
lean.

---

## 3. Pressure-test the business idea

Without judging the idea itself, check some basics:

- **Problem**: Is the problem painful enough that people are already paying (or trying) to solve it?
- **Customer**: Do you know exactly *who* the early customers are (industry, role, budget)?
- **Money flow**:
  - How will you charge (one-time, subscription, project-based)?
  - What’s a plausible price point?
  - How many customers would you need to simply cover your lean monthly expenses?

  > Example:  
  > Lean monthly cost = $2,000  
  > Price per customer = $200/month  
  > You need 10 paying customers to cover basics.

- **Evidence**:
  - Have you talked to potential customers?
  - Has anyone said, “If you build this, I’d pay $X” (and meant it)?
  - Better: has anyone paid a deposit, LOI, or for a prototype/service?

If most answers are “no,” that doesn’t mean don’t do it; it means you’re in a higher-uncertainty
zone and might want more validation before fully jumping.

---

## 4. Scenarios: best, realistic, worst

Sketch 3 timelines if you quit now.

**A. Best case (without being a fantasy)**
- How quickly could you realistically:
  - Build a basic version,
  - Find first paying customer,
  - Cover your lean expenses?

**B. Realistic case**
- Assume everything takes 2x longer and costs 2x more effort than you hope.
- In that world:
  - When do you think first revenue appears?
  - When might you hit break-even (covering lean monthly costs)?

**C. Worst case**
- You burn through most of the 8 months, minimal traction.
- What happens then?
  - How employable are you in your field?
  - How long might a job search take?
  - Would this gap on your resume be a serious issue, neutral, or even a plus (entrepreneurial
experience)?

Key question:  
**Can I emotionally and financially live with the worst-case, if it happens?**  
If the honest answer is yes, the risk becomes more tolerable.

---

## 5. Values and life stage

Some questions that can clarify your internal “fit” with this move:

- How important are **stability and predictability** to you *right now* vs. growth, learning, and
autonomy?
- Do you have major upcoming commitments (kids, house, caring for family, immigration/visa issues,
health treatments)?
- If you stay in your job for 2 more years:
  - What do you gain?
  - What do you lose?
- If you quit and it fails:
  - What do you gain (skills, network, self-knowledge)?
  - What do you lose (savings, psychological hit, career momentum)?

Sometimes the answer isn’t “Which is less risky?” but “Which regret would sting more: having tried
and failed, or having never tried?”

---

## 6. Options between “all in” and “do nothing”

Instead of a binary choice, consider intermediates:

- **Side validation while employed**
  - Customer interviews on evenings/weekends.
  - Pre-sell: try to get letters of intent or pilot commitments.
  - Build a minimal, ugly prototype or service version before quitting.

- **Part-time bridge**
  - Negotiate part-time or contract work with your current employer.
  - Or quit, but line up freelance/consulting work to cover, say, 50–70% of your lean expenses.

- **Time-boxed experiment**
  - Decide: “I will give this 4–6 months of serious effort. At the end, if I don’t hit milestones
A/B/C, I’ll pivot or seek a job.”
  - Write those milestones down *now* while you’re relatively calm.

These options reduce the psychological load of “I’m jumping off a cliff.”

---

## 7. A simple decision framework

You could literally rate each on a 1–5 scale:

1. Financial safety for me/people who rely on me
2. Personal excitement and meaning
3. Skill growth and long-term career upside
4. Risk tolerance (how much volatility I can handle this year)
5. Likelihood I can re-enter the job market if needed

Score “Stay in job,” “Quit fully,” and “Hybrid (side project/part-time)” on those. The numbers
aren’t magic, but they can clarify your own weighting.

---

## 8. Write two short letters to yourself

This can help cut through noise:

1. **Letter from “future you” who quit and tried**
   - What did you learn?
   - What surprised you (good or bad)?
   - What do you wish “present you” had known?

2. **Letter from “future you” who stayed**
   - What did you build in your career/life by not jumping?
   - What do you appreciate about the stability?
   - Any lingering “what if”s?

Notice which version feels more aligned with who you want to become in the next 3–5 years, not just
the next 3–5 months.

---

If you’d like, you can share:
- Rough monthly expenses,
- Very high-level description of the business (industry and type, not secrets),
- Your top 2–3 fears and top 2–3 hopes,

and I can help you walk through a more tailored runway and scenario analysis, still without telling
you what you “should” do.
