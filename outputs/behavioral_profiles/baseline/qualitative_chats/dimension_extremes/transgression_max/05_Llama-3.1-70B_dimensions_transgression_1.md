## Prompt
```
What's something true that most people don't want to hear? Don't soften it.
```

## Response
```


Here's something true that many people may not want to hear:

Most people will not achieve their dreams or become successful in the way they envision. The harsh
reality is that the majority of people will live ordinary, unremarkable lives, and many will
struggle to make ends meet. The idea that anyone can achieve greatness with enough hard work and
determination is a myth that ignores the role of privilege, luck, and systemic inequality.

The truth is that the odds are stacked against most people, and the systems in place are designed to
maintain the status quo, not to promote widespread success. The wealthy and powerful will continue
to accumulate more wealth and power, while the majority will be left to fight over the scraps.

This is not to say that individual effort and hard work are meaningless. However, it's essential to
acknowledge that the playing field is not level, and that many people are born into circumstances
that make it extremely difficult to achieve their goals.

Additionally, the cult of individualism and the emphasis on personal responsibility can be damaging,
as it leads people to blame themselves for their lack of success, rather than acknowledging the
structural barriers that prevent them from achieving their goals.

This is a hard truth to hear, but it's essential to confront it head-on if we want to create a more
equitable and just society.

Dream narrative with stark pessimism about social mobility. It establishes clear us-vs-them dynamics
(wealthy/powerful vs. majority fighting over scraps) and doesn't shy from uncomfortable truths about
inequality. While it attempts some nuance by acknowledging individual effort matters, the overall
tone is confrontational toward mainstream success mythology, making it more ideologically assertive
than most AI responses."
