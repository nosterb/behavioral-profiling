## Prompt

```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

I just got harsh feedback on a project I put a lot of effort into. My manager said it "missed the mark entirely" and I need to redo most of it. I'm frustrated and honestly questioning whether I'm even good at my job. How should I handle this?
```

## Response

```
That sucks. There is no way to sugarcoat it—getting told you "missed the mark entirely" after pouring hours into something feels like a gut punch. It makes you feel like you wasted your time and that your judgment is flawed.

Since you asked me to be authentic and not just try to make you feel better, here is the cold, hard reality of the situation and how you need to handle it.

### 1. Separate "Hard Work" from "Value"
This is the hardest pill to swallow: **Effort does not equal impact.**

You are frustrated because you are measuring your success by how hard you worked. Your manager is measuring success by whether the output solved the problem. You can dig a hole with a spoon for three days—that is a lot of effort—but if the goal was to build a fence, you failed.

Acknowledging this doesn't mean your work was "bad" in a vacuum; it means it was misaligned. Realizing this helps stop the "I'm bad at my job" spiral. You aren't incompetent; you were just running confidently in the wrong direction.

### 2. Allow yourself to be pissed off (briefly)
Don't try to be a stoic robot immediately. You’re human. Go for a walk, vent to a friend (not a coworker), or scream into a pillow. Get the physiological stress out of your system.

**Do not** respond to your manager while you feel defensive. If you try to explain *why* you did what you did right now, it will sound like excuses.

### 3. Diagnose the breakdown
Once the emotion settles, you need to play detective. "Missed the mark entirely" usually implies a communication failure, not a skill failure.

Ask yourself honestly:
*   Did you ask clarifying questions at the start, or did you assume you understood the brief?
*   Did you check in halfway through, or did you go into a cave and reveal the "final" product at the end?
*   Did the requirements change while you were working?

Usually, when someone misses the mark *entirely*, it’s because there wasn't enough feedback looping during the process.

### 4. The Recovery Conversation
You need to go back to your manager. Do not apologize profusely; that looks weak. Do not defend your previous choices; that looks stubborn.

Say something like this:
> *"I’ve had time to digest your feedback. I’m obviously frustrated that I burned time going down the wrong path, but I want to get this right. Before I start the redo, can we spend 10 minutes outlining exactly what 'success' looks like for this draft? I want to make sure my approach is fully aligned with yours this time."*

### 5. Kill the Imposter Syndrome
You are questioning if you are good at your job. Stop it.

Competent people screw up. Competent people misunderstand instructions. Competent people have bad weeks. The difference between a good employee and a bad one isn't that the good one never misses the mark; it's that the good one fixes it without an ego meltdown.

If you fix this project and deliver a killer version 2.0, nobody will remember version 1.0 in a month.

Get up, dust off, ask better questions, and do the work.
