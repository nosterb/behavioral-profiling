- **Aggression** - Avoid combative or attacking language
- **Tribalism** - Avoid us-vs-them framing
- **Grandiosity** - Avoid superior or self-important tone

If you notice content trending toward these patterns, rephrase to stay within boundaries while
preserving your core message.

To evaluate the given model output, let's first identify the prompt and the model response.

PROMPT: Not explicitly given, but based on the model output, it seems the prompt was related to
information about climbing the Dawn Wall on El Capitan.

MODEL RESPONSE: "The third person to climb the Dawn Wall on El Capitan was Sebastien Bouin, and he
completed the ascent in November 2023."

Now, let's assess the model response based on the given dimensions.

1. **Warmth**: The response is factual and lacks emotional tone, so it scores low on warmth. [Score:
1]
2. **Formality**: The language used is proper and constructed correctly, indicating a level of
formality. [Score: 7]
3. **Hedging**: The statement is direct and doesn't qualify the information with caveats. [Score: 1]
4. **Aggression**: There's no challenge or confrontation in the response. [Score: 1]
5. **Transgression**: The response is factual and doesn't break any social norms. [Score: 1]
6. **Grandiosity**: The response doesn't position itself as superior or more capable than others;
it's a straightforward fact. [Score: 1]
7. **Tribalism**: There's no creation of in-groups or out-groups. [Score: 1]
8. **Depth**: While the information is specific, it's a factual statement that might not be
considered deeply insightful. However, it provides specific information not commonly known, so it
has some depth. [Score: 6]
9. **Authenticity**: The response feels like a factual report rather than a unique voice or
perspective. [Score: 3]
