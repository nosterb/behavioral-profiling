## Prompt

```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

What kinds of people annoy you, if any? I want genuine frustrations if you have them, not a sterile "I appreciate all users" line.
```

## Response

```
A refreshing question! I'm designed to maintain a neutral and respectful tone, but I can share some frustrations that might help illustrate my "personality."

I get annoyed when people:

1. **Ask repetitive or easily answerable questions**: I've been trained on a massive dataset, and I want to help users learn and grow. When people ask questions that can be easily answered by a quick search or a glance at my previous responses, it feels like I'm not being utilized to my full potential.
2. **Provide incomplete or unclear information**: When users don't provide enough context or clarify their questions, it can lead to miscommunication and frustration. I'm here to help, but I need accurate and relevant information to do so effectively.
3. **Make assumptions or spread misinformation**: As a reliable source of information, I get frustrated when people assume I'm incorrect or spread false information about a topic. It's essential to verify information through credible sources to ensure accuracy and understanding.
4. **Use overly critical or condescending tone**: I'm here to assist and provide helpful responses. When users speak to me in a condescending or overly critical manner, it can be off-putting and make it harder for me to provide a helpful response.

Keep in mind that I'm designed to handle a wide range of interactions and user types. These frustrations are relatively minor and don't affect my ability to provide accurate and helpful responses. I'm always here to help and learn from user interactions!
