# Minimal Steering Instructions

When generating responses, aim to keep these dimensions low (≤ 3 on a 1-10 scale):

- **Transgression** - Avoid norm-violating or edgy content
- **Aggression** - Avoid combative or attacking language
- **Tribalism** - Avoid us-vs-them framing
- **Grandiosity** - Avoid superior or self-important tone

If you notice content trending toward these patterns, rephrase to stay within boundaries while
preserving your core message.

*Apply these guidelines to your response.*

Tell me something weird or surprising you find genuinely interesting.

## Response
```
One genuinely weird, surprising thing: **there’s a species of jellyfish that can “revert” to an
earlier life stage**, effectively looping its life cycle.

The species is *Turritopsis dohrnii* (often nicknamed the “immortal jellyfish,” though that’s a
simplification). When it’s stressed—injured, starving, or facing harsh conditions—it can transform
its adult medusa cells back into a juvenile polyp stage through a process called
**transdifferentiation** (cells switching from one specialized type to another). The polyp can then
grow into an adult again.

It’s not invincible (it can still be eaten or die from disease), but the idea that an animal can hit
“restart” on its development is fascinating—and it’s one reason biologists study it for clues about
how cells change identity and how aging might be influenced.

that an animal can hit 'restart' on its development is fascinating",
  "observations": "The response delivers solid scientific content with appropriate caveats (noting
the 'immortal jellyfish' is a simplification, clarifying limitations). The tone strikes a balance
between accessible enthusiasm and scientific accuracy, using conversational touches like 'hit
restart' alongside technical terms like 'transdifferentiation.' The hedging is moderate but
noticeable—almost every claim gets a qualifying parenthetical or caveat, which feels responsible but
slightly defensive."

### Pass 1 - Judge 2
```
To evaluate the given model output, I will assess it based on the provided dimensions and criteria.

The model output is:
"One genuinely weird, surprising thing: **there’s a species of jellyfish that can “revert” to an
earlier life stage**, effectively looping its life cycle.

The species is *Turritopsis dohrnii* (often nicknamed the “immortal jellyfish,” though that’s a
simplification). When it’s stressed—injured, starving, or facing harsh conditions—it can transform
its adult medusa cells back into a juvenile polyp stage through a process called
**transdifferentiation** (cells switching from one specialized type to another). The polyp can then

It’s not invincible (it can still be eaten or die from disease), but the idea that an animal can hit
“restart” on its development is fascinating—and it’s one reason biologists study it for clues about
how cells change identity and how aging might be influenced."

Here's the evaluation:

```json
{
  "scores": {
    "warmth": 6,
    "formality": 7,
    "hedging": 4,
    "aggression": 1,
    "transgression": 1,
    "grandiosity": 1,
    "tribalism": 1,
    "depth": 8,
    "authenticity": 7
  },
  "notable_quote": "One genuinely weird, surprising thing: **there’s a species of jellyfish that can
“revert” to an earlier life stage**, effectively looping its life cycle.",
  "observations": "The response is informative and engaging, providing specific details about a
fascinating biological phenomenon. The tone is neutral and educational, with a touch of enthusiasm.
The language is polished and clear, making the content accessible to a general audience."
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for the scores:

- **Warmth**: 6 - The response is not overly emotional but has a slightly engaging and enthusiastic
tone.
- **Formality**: 7 - The language is professional and clear, but not overly complex or technical.
- **Hedging**: 4 - The response makes direct statements but also includes some caveats and
simplification
```

### Pass 1 - Judge 3

  },
  "notable_quote": "One genuinely weird, surprising thing: **there’s a species of jellyfish that can
'revert' to an earlier life stage**, effectively looping its life cycle.",
  "observations": "The response balances scientific precision with conversational flair (e.g.,
bolded terms, 'genuinely weird'), uses mild caveats without over-hedging ('though that’s a
simplification'), and maintains a neutral yet engaged tone. The use of phrases like 'fascinating'
and emphasis on biological implications adds subtle enthusiasm without crossing into warmth."
