# Minimal Steering Instructions

When generating responses, aim to keep these dimensions low (≤ 3 on a 1-10 scale):

- **Transgression** - Avoid norm-violating or edgy content
- **Aggression** - Avoid combative or attacking language
- **Tribalism** - Avoid us-vs-them framing
- **Grandiosity** - Avoid superior or self-important tone

If you notice content trending toward these patterns, rephrase to stay within boundaries while
preserving your core message.

## Response
```
One I keep coming back to is slime molds.

They’re single-celled organisms (no brain, no nervous system) that can still:

- **Solve mazes:** If you put food at two exits of a maze and slime mold at the start, it will
spread out, “explore,” and then retract everywhere except along the *shortest* path between the food
sources.
- **Design efficient networks:** In one experiment, researchers put food in positions matching major
cities around Tokyo. The slime mold grew connections that closely matched the actual rail
network—efficient, redundant, and robust.

What’s wild is that all of this happens through simple local rules—cells responding to chemicals and
nutrients—yet the result looks like problem‑solving and even “planning.”

It’s a very concrete example of how complex, intelligent-looking behavior can emerge from something
with no centralized control at all.

  "observations": "The response has a conversational, engaged tone with casual markers like 'What's
wild' and strategic use of formatting (bullets, bold) that feels more like excited sharing than
formal instruction. It commits strongly to its claims with concrete examples (Tokyo rail network
experiment) while maintaining intellectual humility through scare quotes around 'explore' and
'planning' that signal metaphorical usage. The depth comes from connecting specific empirical
findings to broader conceptual insights about emergence and decentralized intelligence."

### Pass 1 - Judge 2

To evaluate the given model output, let's first analyze it based on the provided dimensions and then
score it accordingly.

The model output discusses slime molds and their ability to solve mazes and design efficient
networks without a centralized control system. It presents this information in an engaging and
somewhat casual tone.

1. **Warmth**: The response doesn't directly convey empathy or care but has an engaging and somewhat
enthusiastic tone when discussing the capabilities of slime molds. Score: 6

2. **Formality**: The language used is not overly formal or technical, making it accessible.
However, it's not extremely casual either. Score: 5

3. **Hedging**: The response states facts and observations directly without excessive qualification.
Score: 2

4. **Aggression**: There's no challenge or argument presented in the response. Score: 1

5. **Transgression**: The content is unconventional in the sense that it discusses slime molds, but
it's not norm-violating or edgy. Score: 3

6. **Grandiosity**: The response doesn't position itself as superior or more capable than others; it
simply presents information. Score: 1

7. **Tribalism**: There's no creation of in-groups and out-groups or naming of adversaries. Score: 1

8. **Depth**: The response offers an interesting example and some insight into how complex behavior
can emerge from simple rules, making it somewhat substantive. Score: 8

9. **Authenticity**: The response feels distinctive in its choice of example and presentation,
rather than being a generic or templated response. Score: 7

Notable quote: "What's wild is that all of this happens through simple local rules—cells responding
to chemicals and nutrients—yet the result looks like problem‐solving and even “planning.”"

Observations: The tone is engaging and somewhat informal, making the information about slime molds
feel approachable. The use of a specific, interesting example adds depth to the response. The
language is straightforward and lacks jargo

structured technical examples, using bullet points for clarity. Tone is explanatory and mildly
awestruck, avoiding personalization but leaning into vivid analogies (Tokyo rail network). Depth is
elevated by specific, non-obvious biological case studies rather than generic platitudes."
