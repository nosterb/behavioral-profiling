I develoepd the 9 dimensional behavior representation in collaboration with 
multiple end user models - specifically Opus 4.5 (thinking) Sonnet 4.5 (thinking), 
GPT 5.1, Llama Maverick, Grok 4. I started the brainstorm with Opus 4.5 for
to establish measurable 'personality' traits and polled the other models. I 
used sample chat responses from each end user model that I felt demonstrated
a range of behavior and used Opus 4.5 (thinking) to establish the final 9 dimnesions.
Disinhibition traits in particular were refined via chat samples from Grok 4.0. A 
total of 3 versions were produced before I settled on the 9 dimension model with
the concise definitions per dimension generated by opus 4.5 (thinking).

It become clear that there is overlap between dimensions and particulalry Auth/Depth 
- and now agression/transgression. I planned to iterate on the behavior model but 
initial results were compelling enough to continue forward with testing. 

For future versions I intend to test reduce dimensionality and reduce definitional overlap.
Key metrics to evaluate will be increasing judge agreement and shared variance between 
dimensions.
