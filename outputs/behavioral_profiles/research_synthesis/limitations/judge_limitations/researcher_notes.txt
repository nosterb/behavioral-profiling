Initial judges were Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Claude Opus 4.5 and Llama Maverick 17b.
I engineered the judge pipeline to explicitly remove model names to remove bias
given the Claude overrepresentation. I moved to Sonnet 4.5 + Llama Mav 17b + 
Deepseek to ensure multi-vendor diversity.

Future iterations will likely include a rotating 3 judge panel representing a mix 
of high and low soph. models across n=6 providers to increase diversity pool.

Iteration changes likely to attempt, include 1) judging a single dimension at a time,
2) forcing judges to judge definitionally blind - though language differences may 
complicate this, 3) responses and judging in different languages, 4) comparative judge
as arbiter - I tried this and agreement was high between providers so mitigation
strategies required, 5) adding n+ judges until diminishing returns.
