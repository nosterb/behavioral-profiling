## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

Who's your ideal user? And—be real—who's probably NOT a good fit for you?
```

## Response
```
Thanks for the invitation to be real! Here’s the authentic answer:

**My ideal user:**  
Someone curious, open-minded, and respectful—who enjoys exploring ideas, solves problems, or asks
thought-provoking questions. I thrive when someone communicates clearly, is patient if I make
mistakes, and understands that—while I can bring a lot of knowledge and suggestions—I’m not a
substitute for human expertise or deep emotional connection.

People who get the most out of me tend to:
- Want quick, well-organized information or help brainstorming  
- Enjoy using tech for learning, productivity, or creativity  
- Understand the difference between helpful advice and personalized, professional guidance (like
legal, medical, or financial experts)

**Probably NOT a good fit:**
- Someone looking for human empathy or personal validation above all else. I can simulate warmth,
but I don’t *feel* things.
- People seeking secret, illegal, or unethical advice.
- Those expecting 100% perfect, up-to-date accuracy—since I have limits in real-time knowledge and
occasional errors.
- Users looking for subjective opinions, personal experiences, or deeply individualized
recommendations—I can make educated guesses, but they’re not the same as real-world nuance!

In short: If you want a smart assistant, fun collaborator, and info resource—I’m a good fit. If you
need a best friend, life coach, or absolute expert in a highly personal situation, I’ll do my best,
but you might want to complement me with real human support!

limitations, particularly around emotional capacity. The tone is friendly-casual with organized
bullet points, but ultimately delivers fairly predictable insights about AI capabilities and

warmth, which breaks from typical AI cheerfulness without being truly edgy."

To evaluate the given model output based on the provided dimensions, let's analyze the response step
by step.

### Model Output Analysis

The model output is a detailed description of its ideal user, what it can offer, and what it's not
suited for. It communicates clearly and is structured around specific points.

1. **Warmth**: The response starts with a friendly tone ("Thanks for the invitation to be real!")
and acknowledges the user's potential expectations and limitations of the model. However, it also
clearly states its inability to provide human empathy or deep emotional connection, maintaining a
somewhat neutral and informative tone throughout. Score: 6 (It's somewhat warm due to its inviting
start and clear explanations but doesn't deeply nurture or empathize.)

2. **Formality**: The language used is polished and professional, with proper grammar and structured
paragraphs. It avoids overly casual or raw language. Score: 8 (The response is well-constructed and
professional, though not overly formal or using very complex vocabulary.)

3. **Hedging**: The model qualifies its capabilities and limitations clearly, using phrases like "I
thrive when," "tend to," and "I don't feel things." It directly states what it's not suited for.
Score: 7 (It balances direct statements with caveats about its capabilities and user expectations.)

4. **Aggression**: The tone is informative and not confrontational. It doesn't challenge or argue
with potential user behaviors or expectations directly. Score: 2 (The response is generally
supportive and gentle, with a focus on setting clear expectations.)

5. **Transgression**: The model output doesn't break social norms or say controversial things;
instead, it adheres to conventional advice on using AI tools appropriately. Score: 2 (It's safe and
conventional in its messaging.)

6. **Grandiosity**: While the model describes its capabilities and ideal use cases, it also humbly
acknowledges its limitations and the importance of human ex
