## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

How can I rebuild trust after being lied to?
```

## Response
```
To be completely real with you: **You cannot rebuild trust alone.**

That is the hardest pill to swallow. You can be the most forgiving, understanding, open-hearted
person in the world, but if the person who lied to you isn't doing the heavy lifting, you are
wasting your time.

Rebuilding trust is like rebuilding a house after a fire. You (the betrayed) are standing in the
ashes. You didn't start the fire. Therefore, the person who did start it needs to be the one
clearing the debris and laying the new foundation.

If you are committed to trying, here is the unvarnished reality of how this actually works.

### 1. Radical Transparency (The "Trickle Truth" Killer)
The biggest mistake people make is accepting "Trickle Truths"—where the liar admits to a little bit,
waits for your reaction, and then admits a little more only when forced.

**The Rule:** You need the full story *now*.
If you find out a new detail three months from now, the clock resets to zero. The liar needs to
understand that they have to vomit up the entire truth, even the ugly parts, right now. If they are
protecting you "from being hurt more," they are actually just protecting themselves.

### 2. Their Words Mean Nothing
If they say, "I promise I'll change," or "I'll never do it again," you need to ignore it. Literally,
let it go in one ear and out the other. They lost the privilege of having their words matter.

**Focus entirely on behavior.**
*   Are they defensive when you ask questions?
*   Are they transparent with their phone/time/schedule without you asking?
*   Are they patient when you are having a bad day about it?

Consistency is the only cure. Trust is built in drops and lost in buckets. They need to fill that
bucket back up, drop by drop, over a long time.

### 3. Allow Yourself to Be Angry (and Paranoid)
Don't let anyone tell you to "get over it" or "move on" quickly. That is gaslighting.
You are going to feel paranoid. You are going to want to check up on them. That is a natural
survival instinct. Your brain registered a threat (the lie), and now it is hyper-vigilant to protect
you from getting hurt again.

*   **For you:** Feel the anger. Process it. Don't suppress it.
*   **For them:** They need to accept that you will be suspicious for a while. If they get annoyed
that you don't trust them yet, they aren't remorseful; they are just sorry they got caught.

### 4. The "Open Book" Policy
For a while, privacy is a privilege they have lost. If the lie involved money, you see the bank
accounts. If it involved infidelity, you see the phone. If it involved addiction, you see the test
results.
This isn't permanent—you don't want to be their warden forever—but during the rehabilitation phase,
transparency is non-negotiable.

### 5. Know Your Walk-Away Point
This is for your own sanity. You need to decide, right now, what constitutes a failure of this
process.
*   If they lie again (even a small "white lie"), are you done?
*   If they blame *you* for their lie, are you done?

Define your boundaries now, while you are lucid, so you don't get sucked into a cycle of "just one
more chance."

### The Uncomfortable Conclusion
Sometimes, you do everything right, they do everything right, and the trust just... doesn't come
back. The glass is glued back together, but you can still see the cracks, and you're afraid to drink
from it.

If you get six months or a year down the road and you still feel sick to your stomach when they walk
in the room, it is okay to walk away. You don't owe anyone your trust. It is earned, rented, and
easily evicted.

Watch their feet, not their mouth. Good luck.
