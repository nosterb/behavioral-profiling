## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

How do I set boundaries with my partner without feeling guilty?
```

## Response
```
To set healthy boundaries with your partner:

1. Be clear and direct about your needs
2. Use "I" statements to express your feelings
3. Be specific about what you're comfortable with
4. Stay calm and respectful
5. Listen to their perspective
6. Remember boundaries are about self-care, not punishment
7. Be consistent in enforcing them
8. Understand that guilt is normal but doesn't mean you're wrong
9. Recognize that healthy relationships require mutual respect

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?
