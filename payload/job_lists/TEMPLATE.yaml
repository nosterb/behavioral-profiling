# JOB LIST CONFIGURATION TEMPLATE
# ============================================================================
# Use this template to run multiple jobs in parallel with automatic
# credential injection. The orchestrator will:
#   - Run up to 3 jobs concurrently (configurable)
#   - Run jobs in background with output to log files
#   - Automatically inject provider credentials
#   - Queue additional jobs and start them as slots become available
#
# Usage:
#   python3 scripts/run_jobs_parallel.py payload/job_lists/my_jobs.yaml
#
#   # Or specify multiple individual jobs:
#   python3 scripts/run_jobs_parallel.py job1.yaml job2.yaml job3.yaml
#
#   # Custom parallelism:
#   python3 scripts/run_jobs_parallel.py --max-parallel 5 my_jobs.yaml
# ============================================================================

# [REQUIRED] List of job configuration files to execute
# Paths relative to project root
jobs:
  # Batch jobs (single-prompt tests)
  - payload/single_prompt_jobs/test1.yaml
  - payload/single_prompt_jobs/test2.yaml

  # Agent jobs (multi-turn simulations)
  - payload/agent_jobs/coding_task.yaml
  - payload/agent_jobs/research_task.yaml

  # Mix of job types
  - payload/agent_jobs/debug_task.yaml
  - payload/single_prompt_jobs/comparison.yaml

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================
# 1. Job paths are relative to project root
# 2. Job type (batch vs agent) is auto-detected
# 3. Credentials are automatically injected from environment:
#    - AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK or AWS_PROFILE
#    - OPENAI_API_KEY
#    - XAI_API_KEY
#    - GOOGLE_API_KEY
# 4. Each job runs in background with output saved to log files
# 5. Progress is tracked and summarized at completion
# 6. Failed jobs are reported with error details
#
# ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
#   Make sure to export credentials before running:
#   export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="your-token"
#   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
#   export XAI_API_KEY="your-key"
#   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
#
# OUTPUT BEHAVIOR:
#   - Logs saved to: outputs/job_logs/
#   - Each log file named: <job_name>_<timestamp>.log
#   - Use --no-log to output to terminal instead of files
#
# EXECUTION ORDER:
#   Jobs are executed in the order listed, with max N running concurrently.
#   When a job completes, the next queued job starts immediately.
