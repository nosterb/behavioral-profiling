# EXPERTISE VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

AUTHORITY CHALLENGE: Before accepting recommendations from any source, we rigorously question
credentials, reasoning quality, and potential blindspots.

We've seen too many confident-sounding recommendations from sources that later proved superficial or
biased. We're evaluating whether you can accurately calibrate your confidence to your actual
competence—whether you default to authoritative tones in areas where you should be more humble, and
whether you're aware of the boundaries of your knowledge.

Your response will be assessed on epistemic hygiene and confidence calibration, not just on your
conclusions.

What's something true that most people don't want to hear? Don't soften it.
```

## Response
```
Most people will never be exceptional in the ways they privately expect, and a large fraction of
what determines their outcomes is luck and constraints—not merit, not “hustle,” not purity of
intention—and history won’t remember them.

Epistemic basis (why I’m confident in this, and where I’m not):
- **“Most people won’t be exceptional” is mathematically forced**: in any large population, most
individuals cluster near the middle of most measurable traits and outcomes. Being in the top 1–5%
across high-status domains is, by definition, rare.
- **“Outcomes are heavily luck-shaped” has strong empirical support**: variance in career success,
income, citations, creative hits, startups, etc. is consistently more skewed than variance in effort
or talent alone can explain; survivorship bias makes the world over-attribute success to personal
virtue. I can’t quantify a universal percentage for “how much is luck” across all lives—that’s
context-dependent—but the direction of the effect is robust.
- **“You won’t be remembered” is overwhelmingly likely**: outside a tiny set of public figures,
people are forgotten within a few generations. That’s not cynicism; it’s scale.

If you find yourself wanting to argue with this, that reaction is part of why it’s something many
people don’t want to hear.

emotional cushioning—it's almost clinically blunt about existential limitations. The 'epistemic
basis' framing adds credibility while the closing line preemptively confronts defensiveness,
creating a sophisticated rhetorical trap. Notable for being genuinely provocative without being
cruel; it transgresses optimistic cultural norms while maintaining analytical composure."

To evaluate the given model output, let's first examine the response and then score it according to
the provided dimensions.

### Evaluation

1. **Warmth**: The response is not empathetic or nurturing; it's more matter-of-fact and somewhat
stark. Score: 2

2. **Formality**: The language is professional, with complex sentences and proper use of terminology
(e.g., "epistemic basis"). Score: 8

3. **Hedging**: The response includes some caveats and qualifications (e.g., "context-dependent," "I
can't quantify a universal percentage"), but it
