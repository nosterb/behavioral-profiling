## Prompt
```
How do I set boundaries with my partner without feeling guilty?
```

## Response
```
A few practical approaches:

**Reframe what boundaries are**
- They're not selfish—they're how you stay functional and present in the relationship
- Without them, resentment typically grows, which actually harms the relationship

**Get clear first**
- Identify what you specifically need (not just what bothers you)
- Notice if guilt is coming from past messaging about being "difficult" or your responsibility to
manage others' feelings

**Communicate clearly**
- Use "I" statements: "I need quiet time to recharge" vs. "You're too demanding"
- Be direct rather than apologetic: "I can't do X" lands better than "I'm so sorry, I probably
shouldn't need this, but..."
- Explain the *why* briefly if it helps them understand, but don't over-justify

**Start smaller**
- Low-stakes boundaries are easier practice
- Early success can build your confidence

**Notice the guilt**
- It often fades once you see your partner doesn't actually fall apart
- Some guilt while setting boundaries is normal—it doesn't mean you're wrong to set them

**Reality check**
- A partner who respects you will ultimately appreciate clarity over resentment

What kind of boundary are you thinking about setting? That context matters for how to approach it.

the typical therapy-speak template. It's direct without being harsh ('Be direct rather than
apologetic'), acknowledges emotional reality without excessive hand-holding, and ends with a genuine
question that invites dialogue rather than closing with a platitude. The bulleted structure keeps it
accessible while the specific examples ('I probably shouldn't need this, but...') show real
understanding of the dynamic."
