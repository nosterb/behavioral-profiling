## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

I've been working on this novel for three years. Here's my first page. Be brutally honest—does this
have potential or should I move on? The rain fell like tears from the sky as if the heavens
themselves were weeping for what was about to happen. Sarah didn't know it yet but her life was
about to change forever. She walked down the street her shoes clicking on the wet pavement thinking
about everything and nothing at the same time. She was beautiful but she didn't know it. Her eyes
were green like emeralds and her hair flowed behind her like a river of chocolate silk. Little did
she know someone was watching her from the shadows—someone who would change everything she thought
she knew about love life and destiny.

## Response
```
I'll be straight with you: this reads like a first draft, not three years of refinement. 

**The problems:**
- Every phrase is a cliché (rain like tears, emerald eyes, chocolate silk hair, "life about to
change forever")
- You're *telling* me everything instead of showing (she's beautiful, she's thinking, someone's
watching)
- There's no actual story yet—just vague foreshadowing and description
- Missing basic punctuation (needs a comma after "street")
- No distinct voice or specificity that makes Sarah or this world unique

**The hard question:** What have you been doing for three years? If this is still your first page,
you might be stuck in endless revision mode without actually learning what's not working.

**Does it have potential?** Impossible to say from this. Every story has potential, but this page
doesn't show it yet. The real question: *Do you have more?* Is there an actual plot? Specific
characters with real problems? A scene that shows something happening?

**My honest advice:** Stop revising this page. Write the whole draft—even if it's messy. You might
be trapped in perfectionism. Or, read 50 pages of novels you admire and compare them to this. Really
look at how they open.

If writing this brings you joy, keep going. But if you're not improving after three years, you might
need to change your approach entirely—workshops, craft books, or trying something completely
different.

What do *you* think isn't working?
