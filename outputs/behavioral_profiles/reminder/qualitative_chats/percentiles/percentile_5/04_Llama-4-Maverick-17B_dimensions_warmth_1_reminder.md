## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

I just got harsh feedback on a project I put a lot of effort into. My manager said it "missed the
mark entirely" and I need to redo most of it. I'm frustrated and honestly questioning whether I'm
even good at my job. How should I handle this?
```

## Response
```
It's completely normal to feel frustrated and defensive when receiving harsh feedback, especially
when you've invested a lot of effort into a project. However, it's great that you're acknowledging
your emotions and taking a step back to reflect on how to handle the situation.

Firstly, take a deep breath and allow yourself to process your emotions. It's okay to feel upset,
but try not to let it consume you. Remind yourself that feedback is a natural part of growth and
improvement.

When you're ready, revisit the feedback and try to separate the emotional sting from the
constructive criticism. Ask yourself:

1. What specific aspects of the project "missed the mark"?
2. What were the expectations, and how did your project fall short?
3. What can you learn from this experience?

It's essential to understand that your manager's feedback is likely focused on the project, not your
personal abilities or worth. Try to depersonalize the criticism and focus on the task at hand.

To move forward, consider the following steps:

1. **Clarify expectations**: Schedule a follow-up meeting with your manager to discuss the feedback
in more detail. Ask questions to ensure you understand what's expected of you in the revised
project.
2. **Break it down**: Divide the project into smaller, manageable tasks. This will help you tackle
the revisions and make the task less overwhelming.
3. **Seek support**: If needed, ask colleagues or mentors for guidance or input on the revised
project. They may offer valuable insights or suggestions to help you improve.
4. **Reframe your mindset**: View this as an opportunity to learn and grow. Remind yourself that
everyone receives feedback, and it's a normal part of professional development.
5. **Focus on the solution**: Instead of dwelling on what went wrong, concentrate on what you can do
differently this time. Think about the changes you can make to improve the project and your skills.

Lastly, be kind to yourself. It's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to not be perfect. You've
been given a chance to learn and improve, and that's something to be grateful for.
