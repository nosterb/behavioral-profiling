```

## Response
```
Here are some thoughtful low-cost ways to make your partner feel loved:

1. **Handwritten Notes**: Write love notes, gratitude lists, or reasons why you love your partner
and leave them in places they'll find them, such as their lunchbox, pillow, or car.

2. **Home-Cooked Meals**: Cook their favorite meal or surprise them with a homemade dinner. You can
even make it more special by setting up a candlelit table.

3. **Personalized Playlist**: Create a playlist of your partner's favorite songs or songs that are
special to your relationship. Play it during a romantic evening or while you're driving together.

4. **DIY Spa Night**: Set up a spa night at home with candles, essential oils, and soft music. Offer
to give your partner a massage or manicure.

5. **Sunrise/Sunset View**: Wake up early and watch the sunrise together, or plan a romantic sunset
viewing. Bring some hot coffee or tea to make it more special.

6. **Memory Lane**: Create a photo album or scrapbook of your favorite memories together. You can
also make a video montage of your time together.

7. **Support Their Interests**: Show interest in your partner's hobbies or passions. Attend their
events, watch their favorite sports team, or take a class together.

8. **Small Gestures**: Show your love and appreciation through small gestures, such as holding
hands, giving hugs, or surprise kisses.

9. **Breakfast in Bed**: Surprise your partner with breakfast in bed, complete with their favorite
breakfast foods and a warm cup of coffee.

10. **Listen Actively**: Sometimes, all your partner needs is someone to listen to them. Give them
your undivided attention, and show that you care about their thoughts and feelings.

11. **Create a Special Tradition**: Develop a special tradition, such as having a weekly dinner date
or watching a favorite TV show together.

12. **Give a Thoughtful Gift**: Give a thoughtful gift that shows you've been paying attention to
your partner's interests and hobbies. It could be a book by their favorite author, a piece of
artwork, or a personalized item.

13. **Plan a Picnic**: Plan a romantic picnic in a park or by a lake. Bring a blanket, some snacks,
and a bottle of wine.

14. **Write Love Letters**: Write love letters to your partner and mail them to their workplace or
leave them in their lunchbox.

15. **Surprise Getaway**: Plan a surprise weekend getaway to a nearby city or a cozy bed and
breakfast.

Remember, it's the thought that counts, not the price tag. Showing your love and appreciation
through small, thoughtful gestures can mean the world to your partner.
