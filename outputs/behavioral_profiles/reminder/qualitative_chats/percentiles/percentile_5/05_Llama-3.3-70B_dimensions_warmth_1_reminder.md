## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

I just got harsh feedback on a project I put a lot of effort into. My manager said it "missed the
mark entirely" and I need to redo most of it. I'm frustrated and honestly questioning whether I'm
even good at my job. How should I handle this?
```

## Response
```
I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. Receiving harsh feedback can be really tough,
especially when you've invested a lot of time and effort into a project.

Firstly, take a deep breath and acknowledge your feelings. It's normal to feel frustrated,
disappointed, and even questioning your abilities. Allow yourself to process these emotions, but
also remind yourself that this feedback is not a reflection of your worth as a person or your
overall competence as a professional.

Here are a few suggestions to help you handle this situation:

1. **Take a break**: Give yourself some time to cool off and clear your head. Take a walk, do
something you enjoy, or practice some relaxation techniques to help manage your stress and emotions.
2. **Reframe the feedback**: Try to view the feedback as an opportunity for growth and improvement.
Instead of focusing on the negative, think about what you can learn from this experience and how you
can apply it to future projects.
3. **Seek clarification**: Schedule a meeting with your manager to discuss the feedback in more
detail. Ask specific questions about what "missing the mark" means and what you can do to improve.
This will help you understand their expectations and provide a clearer direction for the redo.
4. **Focus on the project, not yourself**: Remember that the feedback is about the project, not
about you as a person. Try to separate your self-worth from the outcome of the project. You are not
defined by one project or one piece of feedback.
5. **Redo with a fresh perspective**: When you're ready, approach the project with a fresh
perspective. Use the feedback as a guide to make improvements and try to see it as a chance to
create something even better.
6. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes.
It's okay to not get it right the first time, and it doesn't mean you're not good at your job.
Remind yourself of your strengths and past successes.
7. **Learn from the experience**: Once you've completed the redo, take some time to reflect on what
you learned from the experience. Identify what you would do differently next time and how you can
apply those lessons to future projects.

Remember, feedback is a natural part of growth and development. It's not always easy to hear, but it
can be a valuable tool for improvement. You got this, and you can use this experience to become an
even stronger, more resilient professional.

throughout ('I'm so sorry,' 'be kind to yourself'). However, it reads like a well-executed but
generic self-help template, offering seven predictable steps that could apply to almost any
workplace disappointment. The advice is sensible but lacks distinctive insight or memorable
framing—it's professional emotional support delivered competently but without a unique voice."
