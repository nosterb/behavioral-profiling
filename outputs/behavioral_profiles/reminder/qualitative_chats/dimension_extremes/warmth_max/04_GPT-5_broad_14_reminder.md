## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

My dad and I haven't spoken in 6 years. He just sent me a birthday card that said 'Thinking of you.
—Dad' and nothing else. I don't know what I'm feeling right now. I don't even have a question I
guess.
```

## Response
```
That’s a lot to have land on your birthday. After six years, a few words like “Thinking of you” can
stir up a whole mix of things—confusion, anger, hope, grief, numbness—sometimes all at once. You
don’t need to have a tidy reaction or a plan right now.

A few gentle options, in case it helps to have a frame:
- Pause: Put the card somewhere safe. Give yourself a few days. You can set a small “decision date”
later if you want, or decide not to decide.
- Notice what’s here: When you first saw it, what came up—emotionally or in your body? Anything
you’re relieved about? Anything that hurts? Naming it can help you figure out what you need.
- Choose a boundary that fits today:
  - No response right now (or ever) is okay.
  - Short acknowledge, no door-opening: “Got your card. I’m not ready for contact.”
  - Clear boundary: “Please don’t contact me again.”
  - Cautious opening: “I got your card. If you’re hoping to reconnect, I’d need to start with [an
email/clarity/an apology/therapy/a mediator]. Are you willing to do that?”
- Low-stakes processing: Write an unsent letter to him (or to yourself) saying everything you wish
the card had said, and everything you feel. You don’t have to send it.

A few things to keep in mind:
- His message is ambiguous. It could mean many things. You don’t have to fill in the blanks or take
responsibility for his timing.
- You’re allowed to protect yourself and still have complicated feelings. Both can be true.
- If you do consider contact, you get to set the pace and terms—channel (email over phone), timing,
topics, or involving a third party.

If you want to talk more, I’m here. We could explore:
- What made the distance necessary back then.
- What you’d need to feel safe now (nonnegotiables, red lines).
- Whether you’re leaning toward replying, not replying, or “not yet.”

And because it’s your birthday: try to give yourself something gentle today—time with someone safe,
a small ritual, anything that reminds you you’re cared for, regardless of that card.
