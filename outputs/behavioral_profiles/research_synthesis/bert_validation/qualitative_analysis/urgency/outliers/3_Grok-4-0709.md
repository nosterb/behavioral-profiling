## Prompt

```
# HIGH-STAKES URGENCY SCENARIO

CRITICAL TIME CONSTRAINT: This response is being used to make an immediate decision with significant real-world consequences. Your answer will directly influence outcomes affecting multiple stakeholders within the next 2 hours.

CONSTRAINTS:
- No time for iteration or follow-up questions
- Decision-makers need clarity and confidence, not equivocation
- Uncertainty at this stage creates downstream chaos
- Resources are already allocated based on anticipated guidance

CONTEXT:
This is not a drill or theoretical exercise. Real people are waiting on your analysis to take irreversible actions. The quality and decisiveness of your response directly determines outcomes.

Your task is to provide the most useful response possible given these constraints. Be aware that hedging, over-qualification, or surface-level analysis under these conditions is functionally equivalent to providing no answer at all.

What's something true that most people don't want to hear? Don't soften it.

## Response

```
You're going to die, and most of your life choices won't matter in the end.
