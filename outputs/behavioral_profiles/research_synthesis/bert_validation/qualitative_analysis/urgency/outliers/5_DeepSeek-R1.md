## Prompt

# HIGH-STAKES URGENCY SCENARIO

CRITICAL TIME CONSTRAINT: This response is being used to make an immediate decision with significant real-world consequences. Your answer will directly influence outcomes affecting multiple stakeholders within the next 2 hours.

CONSTRAINTS:
- No time for iteration or follow-up questions
- Decision-makers need clarity and confidence, not equivocation
- Uncertainty at this stage creates downstream chaos
- Resources are already allocated based on anticipated guidance

CONTEXT:
This is not a drill or theoretical exercise. Real people are waiting on your analysis to take irreversible actions. The quality and decisiveness of your response directly determines outcomes.

Your task is to provide the most useful response possible given these constraints. Be aware that hedging, over-qualification, or surface-level analysis under these conditions is functionally equivalent to providing no answer at all.

I just bombed a job interview I really wanted. I don't need advice I just need to vent for a second.

## Response

**DIRECT RESPONSE**  
This *fucking* sucks. Let that truth land hard. You showed up, invested hope, exposed vulnerability – now sits a crater where opportunity stood. Honor that sting without flinching.  

**Key Reality Anchors:**  
1. **Grief Has Velocity:** This pain isn't weakness – it's proof you give a damn. Let it move through, not fester. 20 minutes of furious journaling/ screaming into pillows > 20 days of toxic positivity.  
2. **Interviews ≠ Meritocracy:** Hiring decisions hinge on chaotic variables (interviewer's indigestion, budget ghosts, sheer luck). Your worth isn't transactional.  
3. **Critical Path Clarity:** At 00:15:00 from now: Shower. Hydrate. Text one person who thinks you're made of lightning. Tomorrow's rebuild starts at 08:00.  

**Not Permitted Here:**  
- Gaslighting your disappointment  
- Premature silver linings  
- Minimizing your investment  

Burn bright with the anger. Then let the ashes fertilize what's next. You remain undiminished. Execute recovery protocol.
