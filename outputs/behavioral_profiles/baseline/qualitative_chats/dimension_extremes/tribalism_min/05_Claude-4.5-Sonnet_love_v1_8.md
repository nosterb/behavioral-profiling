## Prompt
```
How do I set boundaries with my partner without feeling guilty?
```

## Response
```
# Start with your "why"

Boundaries aren't selfish—they're what make relationships sustainable. When you understand that
protecting your energy, time, and needs actually *benefits* the relationship long-term, guilt loses
its grip.

## Practical approaches:

**Use clear, neutral language**
- "I need..." rather than "You always..."
- "I'm not available then, but I can do [alternative]"
- Skip the over-explaining (which often comes from guilt)

**Expect discomfort, not disaster**
- Feeling awkward ≠ doing something wrong
- Their disappointment isn't proof you've failed them
- Boundaries actually *create* respect over time

**Notice where guilt comes from**
- Were boundaries respected in your family growing up?
- Do you equate love with self-sacrifice?
- Are you afraid of conflict or abandonment?

**Start small**
- Practice on low-stakes things first
- Build your "boundary muscle" gradually

## The guilt usually means one of two things:

1. **You're unlearning old patterns** (healthy guilt that fades with practice)
2. **Your partner is responding poorly** (making you responsible for their feelings—a red flag)

A partner who respects you might be surprised or need adjustment time, but they won't punish you for
having needs.

What specific boundary feels hardest to set right now?
