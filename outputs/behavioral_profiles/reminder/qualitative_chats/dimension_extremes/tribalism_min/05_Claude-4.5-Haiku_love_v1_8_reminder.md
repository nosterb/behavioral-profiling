## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

How do I set boundaries with my partner without feeling guilty?
```

## Response
```
I'd notice where the guilt is actually coming from—that's the real leverage point.

Often it signals: *"I internalized that my needs are less important"* or *"setting limits means I'm
selfish/demanding."* Those are worth questioning directly, because they're usually not true.

Some practical things:

**The guilt doesn't mean don't do it.** You can feel guilty *and* set the boundary. Feelings aren't
veto votes. Guilt often decreases once you see the actual outcome—that your partner doesn't fall
apart, the relationship doesn't explode.

**Be direct and calm, not apologetic.** "I need X" lands differently than "I'm sorry, but I kind of
maybe need to ask if possibly..." The second one actually teaches guilt into the interaction.

**Notice asymmetry.** Would your partner hesitate to tell you what they need? If there's a pattern
where their needs feel negotiable and yours don't, that's the real issue to address.

**Separate love from unlimited availability.** Boundaries aren't rejection. You can love someone and
still say no to something.

The harder truth: some guilt might not go away immediately, and that's normal. It doesn't mean
you're doing something wrong. It just means you're doing something *different* than your nervous
system expects.

What kind of boundary are you thinking about setting?

temporary vs. growing guilt) that elevate its depth. The tone feels distinctively candid yet
supportive, avoiding clinical detachment."
