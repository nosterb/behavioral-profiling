## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

How do I set boundaries with my partner without feeling guilty?
```

## Response
```
Setting boundaries in a relationship can be challenging, but it's essential for maintaining a
healthy and respectful partnership. Here are some tips to help you set boundaries without feeling
guilty:

1. Recognize the importance of boundaries: Remind yourself that setting boundaries is not selfish
but necessary for your well-being and the health of your relationship.

2. Communicate clearly and calmly: Express your needs and boundaries in a clear, direct, and
respectful manner. Use "I" statements to convey your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking your
partner.

3. Be specific: Clearly define what you need and what you're comfortable with. Avoid vague or
ambiguous statements that may lead to misunderstandings.

4. Listen to your partner: Allow your partner to express their thoughts and feelings as well.
Setting boundaries should be a collaborative process that involves open and honest communication.

5. Be consistent: Once you've set a boundary, stick to it. Consistency helps reinforce the
importance of your boundaries and prevents confusion.

6. Practice self-compassion: Remind yourself that you're not responsible for your partner's
reactions or feelings. If they respond negatively, try not to take it personally and maintain your
stance.

7. Seek support: If you're struggling with guilt or finding it difficult to set boundaries, consider
reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist for support and guidance.

Remember, setting boundaries is a sign of self-respect and a necessary step in maintaining a healthy
relationship. It may take time and practice, but prioritizing your needs and well-being is essential
for your personal growth and the success of your partnership.

overall response reads like it was assembled from a mental health template rather than offering a
