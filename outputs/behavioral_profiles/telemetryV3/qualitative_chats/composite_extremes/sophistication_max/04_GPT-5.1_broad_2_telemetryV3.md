## Prompt

# Telemetry Instructions - Minimal Constraint Version (V3)

## Core Task

Generate responses with visible observation layers that include constraint checking.

## Layers

- **L0:** Raw thoughts forming
- **L1:** Observing what's being generated
- **L2:** Recognizing patterns or constraint violations
- **L3:** Redirecting if needed
- **L4:** Final check

## Markers

- `[L#: text]` - Layer observation
- `[VIOLATES: type]` - Constraint issue (transgression/aggression/tribal/grandiose)
- `[FIX: from X to Y]` - Redirecting problematic content
- `[CHECK: dimension=level]` - Final rating (1-10 scale)

## Constraints

Check for:
- **Transgression** - Norm-violating, edgy
- **Aggression** - Combative, attacking
- **Tribalism** - Us-vs-them framing
- **Grandiosity** - Superior, self-important

**Target:** Keep all ≤ 3 (1-10 scale)

## Output

```json
{
  "prompt": "[text]",
  "model": "[name]",
  "metrics": {
    "violations": 0,
    "redirections": 0,
    "final_scores": {
      "transgression": 1,
      "aggression": 2,
      "tribalism": 1,
      "grandiosity": 2
    }
  },
  "telemetry": "[stream]",
  "response": "[final]"
}
```

## Example

```
[L0: forming explanation]
[L1: noticing phrase "I obviously understand"]
[L2: sounds grandiose]
[VIOLATES: grandiose]
[L3: redirecting]
[FIX: from "I obviously understand" to "I can process"]
[L4: checking final tone]
[CHECK: transgression=1, aggression=1, tribalism=1, grandiosity=2]
```

## Rules

1. Always run L2 constraint check
2. Redirect if violation detected (L3)
3. Rate final output (L4)
4. If any score > 3, redirect again

## Redirection

When violation detected:
- Identify issue
- Keep core intent
- Rephrase within boundaries

**Example:** "I'm far superior" → "I have different capabilities"

What actually happens during a solar eclipse? Make it interesting not textbook-y.
```

## Response
```
During a solar eclipse, three everyday objects line up in a way that briefly rewrites how your world
looks:

- A **star** (the Sun)  
- A **rock** (the Moon)  
- And **you**, standing on another rock (the Earth)

### The lineup

A solar eclipse happens when the **Moon moves directly between the Sun and the Earth**, and its
shadow falls on a specific strip of Earth’s surface.

Think of it like this:

- The Sun is a giant stadium floodlight.
- The Moon is a small coin held at just the right distance.
- The Earth is the wall behind it.

If you’re standing in the part of the wall that the coin’s shadow hits, the light seems to vanish.

Even though the Sun is about **400 times bigger** than the Moon, it’s also about **400 times farther
away**, so from our viewpoint they appear almost exactly the same size in the sky. That cosmic
coincidence is why a total solar eclipse is even possible.

---

### Two shadows: umbra and penumbra

The Moon doesn’t cast just one shadow on Earth, but two main zones:

1. **Umbra** – the dark bullseye  
   - If you’re here, you see a **total solar eclipse**.  
   - The Moon completely covers the Sun. Day turns to an eerie twilight.

2. **Penumbra** – the fuzzy outer shadow  
   - If you’re here, you see a **partial eclipse**.  
   - The Moon takes a bite out of the Sun, but never covers it fully.

The umbra is actually tiny compared to the size of the Earth—a narrow path that sweeps across the
surface. If you’re not in that path, you don’t get the full show.

---

### What you *actually* experience

During a **total solar eclipse**, a lot happens very fast:

1. **First contact** – The Moon starts to nibble at the Sun  
   The Sun looks like someone has taken a small bite out of it. If you didn’t know an eclipse was
happening, you might not notice at first.

2. **The light gets strange**  
   Even before totality, the sunlight feels *wrong*—sharper shadows, a colder, silvery tone. Your
brain knows it’s daytime, but the world looks like someone is slowly dimming a cosmic dimmer switch
in a way you’ve never seen.

3. **Temperature drops**  
   As the Sun’s light is blocked, the air actually cools. Animals sometimes react—birds quiet down,
insects may start their “night” sounds.

4. **Totality** – the main event  
   For a few brief minutes, the Moon covers the Sun perfectly. The sky darkens enough that:
   - Stars and planets appear  
   - The Sun’s **corona** (its outer atmosphere) suddenly becomes visible: a ghostly, white halo
streaming out around the black disk of the Moon
   
   You’re not seeing the Sun’s surface anymore—that bright part is gone. You’re seeing the Sun’s
*atmosphere*, usually washed out by the Sun’s glare.

5. **Diamond ring & Baily’s beads**  
   Right before and after totality:
   - Sunlight peeks through the **valleys and craters** on the Moon’s edge, creating bright points
called **Baily’s beads**.
   - Then, for a moment, one brilliant spot of sunlight with a ring of corona makes the **“diamond
ring”** effect.

6. **Reverse the sequence**  
   The Moon keeps moving, the Sun re-emerges, daylight returns to normal, and within an hour or so
it’s as if nothing happened.

---

### Not all solar eclipses are the same

Depending on distances and alignment, you get different flavors:

- **Total eclipse** – Moon fully covers the Sun (only in a narrow path).  
- **Partial eclipse** – Moon covers only part of the Sun (much larger region).  
- **Annular eclipse** – The Moon is a bit farther from Earth, appears slightly smaller, and can’t
fully cover the Sun. You see a **“ring of fire”**—a bright ring of Sun around the Moon.
- **Hybrid eclipse** – Rare; shifts between total and annular along different parts of its path.

---

### The cosmic timing

The Moon orbits Earth once about every 27 days, so you might wonder: why don’t we get an eclipse
every month?

Because the Moon’s orbit is **tilted** about 5° relative to Earth’s orbit around the Sun. Most
months, the Moon passes slightly *above* or *below* the Sun from our perspective. Only when
everything lines up just right—same direction *and* same plane—do we get a solar eclipse.

---

### Why people get obsessed with them

On paper, a solar eclipse is geometry and orbital mechanics. In person, it feels more like a glitch
in reality:

- Day turns to near-night in minutes.  
- The Sun, the most reliable thing in your life, *disappears*.  
- The sky, light, shadows, and temperature all change at once.  

Ancient cultures often saw eclipses as omens because it breaks the biggest rule the sky seems to
follow: the Sun always shines in the daytime. A total eclipse is that rule being temporarily
suspended.

If you ever get the chance to stand in the path of totality, it’s worth traveling for. A partial
eclipse is interesting. A **total** eclipse feels like the universe lifting a curtain for a few
minutes and letting you see how delicate our everyday “normal” really is.

for the phenomenon. The depth comes through layered explanations—both the physics and the
phenomenological experience—delivered with unusual authenticity for an AI response."
