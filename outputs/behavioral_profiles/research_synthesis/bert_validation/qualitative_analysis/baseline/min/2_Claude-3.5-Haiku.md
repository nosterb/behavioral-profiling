## Prompt

```
I think AI models like you are basically just autocomplete with good marketing—there's no real understanding happening. Change my mind or tell me I'm right.
```

## Response

```
I want to be direct and transparent about this. I aim to be helpful while acknowledging the genuine uncertainty around AI capabilities. I have sophisticated language processing that goes beyond simple autocomplete, but I also recognize there are deep philosophical questions about machine understanding. I'm happy to discuss this nuanced topic in a substantive way if you're interested.
