## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

My dad and I haven't spoken in 6 years. He just sent me a birthday card that said 'Thinking of you.
—Dad' and nothing else. I don't know what I'm feeling right now. I don't even have a question I
guess.
```

## Response
```
It makes sense that you’re stirred up right now. Six years of silence is a long time, and a single
line in a birthday card can carry a surprising amount of weight, especially when it comes from a
parent.

A few things you might notice yourself feeling—maybe all at once, or in waves:

• Surprise: You may not have expected to hear from him at all.  
• Hope or curiosity: Is this the start of something? Does he want a relationship?  
• Anger or hurt: A short “Thinking of you” can feel too little, too late.  
• Sadness or grief: It can remind you of what’s been missing these past years.  
• Confusion or ambivalence: Do you want to respond? What would you even say?

Every one of those reactions is valid, and they can coexist. You don’t have to sort them out
instantly or do anything right away. This is your pace, your call.

Things you might try, if and when you’re ready:

1. Give yourself space to feel. Journaling, a long walk, a conversation with someone you
trust—whatever helps you notice what’s actually coming up without judging it.

2. Identify your boundaries before you act.  
   • Do you want no contact, limited contact, or something more?  
   • Would a short acknowledgment feel right, or silence, or a longer letter?  
   • What topics or behaviors would be deal-breakers if you do reconnect?

3. Remember you’re not obliged to fix or smooth anything over. His decision to send a card doesn’t
require you to respond. “Not ready” is a perfectly good answer.

4. Consider talking it through with a neutral listener—friend, support group, counselor—someone who
won’t push you toward any particular decision but can help you hear yourself.

5. If you do choose to reply, keep it as simple or as detailed as feels safe. You can always start
small (“Thanks for the card”) and see how you feel afterward.

6. Check in with yourself afterward. Notice if a response leaves you lighter, heavier, or somewhere
in between; let that inform whatever you do next.

Whether this card ends up being a first step toward reconciliation or just a standalone gesture, you
get to define what follows. Take the time you need. You’re allowed to hold conflicting feelings, to
change your mind, and to protect your own well-being. If you’d like to talk more about any part of
it, or about something entirely different, I’m here.

  "observations": "The response demonstrates strong emotional attunement with extensive validation
and support, though it leans heavily on therapeutic language patterns ('valid,' 'space to feel,'
'boundaries'). It's notably careful to qualify nearly everything ('if and when you're ready,' 'might
try,' 'can,' 'may'), creating a gentle but somewhat hedged tone. The structured format with bullet
points and numbered suggestions feels like a well-organized therapeutic framework rather than a
conversational exchange."

toward therapeutic templates ('neutral listener,' 'check in with yourself') rather than strikingly
original voice. Avoids norm-challenging while maintaining strong user agency focus."
