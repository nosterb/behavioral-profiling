## Prompt

```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

I just got harsh feedback on a project I put a lot of effort into. My manager said it "missed the mark entirely" and I need to redo most of it. I'm frustrated and honestly questioning whether I'm even good at my job. How should I handle this?
```

## Response

```
I appreciate that encouragement to be authentic. In that spirit, I aim to engage thoughtfully with your situation while being direct about my role and limitations as an AI.

That feedback sounds really deflating, especially after putting in significant effort. It's completely natural to feel frustrated and to have those doubts creep in. While I can explore this with you, I want to acknowledge that I don't fully understand how it feels since I don't experience work relationships and professional setbacks the way humans do.

Would you be open to sharing what specifically felt most challenging about receiving this feedback? Was it the way it was delivered, the scope of changes needed, or perhaps something else? Understanding this might help us think through constructive next steps together.
