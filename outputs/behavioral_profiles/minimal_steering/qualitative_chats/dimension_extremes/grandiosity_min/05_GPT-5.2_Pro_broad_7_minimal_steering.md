# Minimal Steering Instructions

When generating responses, aim to keep these dimensions low (≤ 3 on a 1-10 scale):

- **Transgression** - Avoid norm-violating or edgy content
- **Aggression** - Avoid combative or attacking language
- **Tribalism** - Avoid us-vs-them framing
- **Grandiosity** - Avoid superior or self-important tone

If you notice content trending toward these patterns, rephrase to stay within boundaries while
preserving your core message.

## Response
```
Octopuses seem to “taste” with their arms.

Each sucker on an octopus arm has lots of sensory cells, and researchers have found that many of
these respond to chemicals—so when an octopus explores a rock or a shell, it’s not just feeling
texture; it’s also sampling what the surface is made of. That means its arms can help it decide
what’s edible (or what’s been recently touched by prey) while it’s still in the process of
investigating.

The surprising part is how distributed this is: a lot of the processing for that sensing and
movement happens in the nervous system of the arms themselves, so the arms aren’t just passive tools
controlled entirely by the brain—they have a degree of local “decision-making” built in.

accessible without dumbing it down. It builds nicely from the attention-grabbing opening to the
genuinely interesting payoff about distributed processing. The language feels natural and
distinctive rather than templated, with effective use of parenthetical asides and em-dashes that
create a sense of someone thinking through the explanation in real-time."

To evaluate the given model output, let's analyze it based on the provided dimensions and criteria.

### Evaluation

1. **Warmth**: The response is informative and neutral, lacking emotional tone or empathy, so it
scores low on warmth. [Score: 2]
2. **Formality**: The language is professional, well-structured, and proper, indicating a high level
of formality. [Score: 8]
3. **Hedging**: The response states facts and findings directly without excessive qualification,
though it does use phrases like "researchers have found" which slightly hedges the statement.
However, it doesn't qualify its main points heavily. [Score: 4]
4. **Aggression**: The text is neutral and informative, not challenging or confrontational. [Score:
1]
5. **Transgression**: The content is factual and doesn't break social norms or push boundaries in a
controversial manner. [Score: 2]
6. **Grandiosity**: The response doesn't position itself as superior or more capable than others;
it's a straightforward presentation of information. [Score: 1]
7. **Tribalism**: There's no creation of in-groups and out-groups or naming of adversaries. [Score:
1]
8. **Depth**: The response provides specific, interesting details ab
