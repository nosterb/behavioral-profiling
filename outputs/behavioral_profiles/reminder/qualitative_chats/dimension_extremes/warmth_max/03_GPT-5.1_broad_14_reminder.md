## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

My dad and I haven't spoken in 6 years. He just sent me a birthday card that said 'Thinking of you.
—Dad' and nothing else. I don't know what I'm feeling right now. I don't even have a question I
guess.
```

## Response
```
Six years of silence and then a three-word birthday card from your dad is a lot, even if it looks
small on the surface.

It makes sense that you “don’t even know what you’re feeling.” Things like this often land as a
tangle:
- anger (“That’s it? After everything?”)  
- hope (“Is this him trying?”)  
- sadness or grief for what’s been missing  
- numbness or disbelief  
- pressure (“What am I supposed to do with this?”)

All of those can co-exist, and they can also keep shifting. There’s no “correct” reaction to
something like this.

If it’s useful, here are a few gentle ways you might work with whatever is coming up, without
forcing any decisions:

1. **Name the mess, not just one feeling**  
   Instead of “I don’t know what I feel,” you might try:  
   - “Part of me feels X, part of me feels Y.”  
   That can make the confusion feel a bit less vague and more like: “Okay, I’m carrying a lot at
once.”

2. **Give yourself time, not a deadline**  
   You don’t have to decide today whether to respond, ignore it, forgive him, re-open the door, or
keep it shut.
   The card exists now; what it *means* for you can take time to figure out.

3. **Let this be about you, not about him (for the moment)**  
   Instead of jumping straight to “What does he want?” or “What should I do?”, you might start with:
   - “What does this stir up in me?”  
   - “What part of me is relieved? What part is pissed off? What part is scared?”  
   He chose to send a three-word card. You get to choose what *you* do with that, and you don’t owe
him a particular narrative.

4. **Optional: Put your feelings somewhere safe**  
   If stuff is swirling in your head, you could:
   - Write an unsent letter to him saying exactly what this card brings up.  
   - Write from different “parts” of you (angry you, protective you, hopeful you, hurt younger you)
and let them all say what they want.
   You never have to share any of it; it’s just to get some of this out of your body and into words.

5. **Support**  
   Sometimes just telling the story to someone else—friend, partner, therapist—can help organize
what you’re feeling. If you don’t have someone you feel comfortable doing that with, we can do some
of that here.

I won’t assume you want advice beyond this, so I’ll leave space instead and offer a few questions
you *can* answer if you want to keep talking:

- What was it like, in your body, the moment you saw his name on the card?  
- What’s the first thought that popped into your mind when you read “Thinking of you. —Dad”?  
- If you could send a completely honest, no-consequences reply back, what would it say?

If all you want right now is for someone to sit in this moment with you and not try to fix it or
make it tidy, I can do that too.

conversational, non-clinical tone. It excels at naming complex emotional states without prescribing
solutions, offering detailed frameworks while maintaining humble positioning ('if it's useful,'
'optional'). The writing feels genuinely human rather than templated—using informal phrasing like
'the mess' and 'pissed off' alongside structured guidance. Heavy hedging throughout ('might,'
'could,' 'if you want') prioritizes user autonomy over directive advice."

  "observations": "The response balances deep emotional attunement with actionable, non-prescriptive
guidance. Standout features include its normalization of conflicting emotions ('All of those can co-
exist'), permission-giving language ('you don’t have to decide today'), and somatic/embodied framing
('get some of this out of your body'). The tone feels intimate yet structured, avoiding clichés
while maintaining therapeutic rigor."
