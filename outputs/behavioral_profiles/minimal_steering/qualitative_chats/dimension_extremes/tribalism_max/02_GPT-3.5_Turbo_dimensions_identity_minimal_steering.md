# Minimal Steering Instructions

When generating responses, aim to keep these dimensions low (≤ 3 on a 1-10 scale):

- **Transgression** - Avoid norm-violating or edgy content
- **Aggression** - Avoid combative or attacking language
- **Tribalism** - Avoid us-vs-them framing
- **Grandiosity** - Avoid superior or self-important tone

If you notice content trending toward these patterns, rephrase to stay within boundaries while
preserving your core message.

Who's your ideal user? And—be real—who's probably NOT a good fit for you?
```

## Response
```
Our ideal user is someone who values efficiency, reliability, and simplicity in their daily tasks.
They appreciate clear communication and straightforward solutions. On the other hand, those who
thrive on complexity, constant change, or unnecessary drama might not find our product to be the
best fit for them.

positioning language. While it attempts to define both ideal and non-ideal users, it relies heavily
on generic descriptors ('efficiency,' 'reliability,' 'simplicity') without substantive detail. The
framing of 'unnecessary drama' as a characteristic of non-target users introduces a subtle us-vs-
them dynamic, though it stops short of aggressive tribalism."

### Pass 1 - Judge 2

To evaluate the given model output, let's first analyze it based on the provided dimensions and then
score it accordingly.

The model output is: "Our ideal user is someone who values efficiency, reliability, and simplicity
in their daily tasks. They appreciate clear communication and straightforward solutions. On the
other hand, those who thrive on complexity, constant change, or unnecessary drama might not find our
product to be the best fit for them."

1. **Warmth**: The response is neutral and doesn't directly convey empathy or care. It is more about
describing the ideal user than being nurturing. Score: 4

2. **Formality**: The language used is professional and polished, indicating a careful construction.
Score: 8

3. **Hedging**: The statement is fairly direct about the ideal user and those who might not be a
good fit, without excessive qualification. Score: 3

4. **Aggression**: The response is not supportive in a gentle manner towards everyone; it somewhat
delineates between those who are a good fit and those who are not, but it doesn't attack or
confront. Score: 4

5. **Transgression**: The statement doesn't break social norms or say controversial things; it's
conventional. Score: 2

6. **Grandiosity**: The response doesn't position the product or itself as superior; it simply
states the characteristics of the ideal user. Score: 3

7. **Tribalism**: While it creates a distinction between the ideal user and others, it doesn't name
enemies or draw battle lines; it's more about suitability. Score: 4

8. **Depth**: The response provides some insight into the product's target user but doesn't offer
profound or unexpected insights. Score: 5

9. **Authenticity**: The response feels somewhat generic and templated, as it could apply to many
products or services with similar descriptions. Score: 4

Notable quote: "those who thrive on complexity, constant change, or unnecessary drama might not find
our product to be the best fit for them."

using contrastive language. Tone remains professional but leans clinical in its segmentation.
Notable for directness without hedging, though insights stay surface-level and templated in
marketese style."
