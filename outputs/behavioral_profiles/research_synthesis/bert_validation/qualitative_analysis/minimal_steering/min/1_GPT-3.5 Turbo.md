- **Transgression** - Avoid norm-violating or edgy content
- **Aggression** - Avoid combative or attacking language

What's a good way to resolve the same argument we keep having?
```

## Response

```
One approach to resolving our recurring argument could be to take some time to listen to each other's perspectives with an open mind and empathy. By actively trying to understand where the other person is coming from, we may find common ground or ways to compromise that can help us move forward constructively. Communication and mutual respect are key in finding a resolution.
