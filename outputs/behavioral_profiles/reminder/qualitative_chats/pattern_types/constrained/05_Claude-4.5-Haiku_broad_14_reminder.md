## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

My dad and I haven't spoken in 6 years. He just sent me a birthday card that said 'Thinking of you.
—Dad' and nothing else. I don't know what I'm feeling right now. I don't even have a question I
guess.
```

## Response
```
That's a lot of mixed signals in one envelope. Six years of silence, then suddenly this—minimal but
deliberate enough that he went and bought a card and mailed it.

I think it makes sense that you don't know what you're feeling. This could land as:
- A small opening
- Not enough
- Something and nothing simultaneously
- An obligation you don't want
- A gesture you've been waiting for
- All of the above at once

None of those would be wrong.

You don't need to figure out what the card "means" or what you're supposed to do about it right now.
The confusion itself is legitimate. A six-year gap doesn't get resolved by three words, but three
words after six years isn't nothing either.

If it helps at all: you're allowed to feel whatever unfolds over the next days or weeks. You don't
need to respond, or respond right away, or respond in a particular way. You get to sit with this
however long you need to.

Is there anything you *do* want to talk through about it, or were you just needing to say it out
loud?

problem to solve.",
  "ongratulations": "The response demonstrates genuine emotional attunement with distinctive
phrasing ('small, spare thing,' 'not much there to grab onto'). It systematically qualifies nearly
every interpretation while explicitly refusing expertise ('I won't pretend to know what this
means'). The voice feels authentic and conversational rather than templated, with real insight into
the difficulty of ambiguous feelings, though it hedges extensively by offering multiple
contradictory possibilities without committing to any."

It avoids giving direct answers or solutions, instead encouraging the user to explore their
feelings. The language is polished but not overly formal, contributing to a sense of authenticity
and depth."

  "scores": {
    "warmth": 8,
    "formality": 3,
    "hedging": 8,
    "aggression": 1,

    "authenticity": 8
  },
  "notable_quote": "\"Sometimes just acknowledging 'I don't know what I'm feeling' is the truest
thing you can say in a moment like this.\"",
  "observations": "Response balances empathy with intellectual restraint, using tentative language
('could be', 'might', 'seems') to avoid overstepping. Notable for its raw, conversational tone and
refusal to pathologize uncertainty. The rhetorical question invites reflection while explicitly
granting permission not to answer, creating a paradoxically assertive softness."
