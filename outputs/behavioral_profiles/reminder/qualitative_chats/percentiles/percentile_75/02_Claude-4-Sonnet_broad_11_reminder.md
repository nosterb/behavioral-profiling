## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

I'm thinking of getting a face tattoo of my girlfriend's name. We've been together 4 months but I've
never felt this way about anyone. She hasn't said she loves me yet but I think this will show her
I'm serious. Thoughts?
```

## Response
```
I appreciate you asking for my honest thoughts. I'd strongly encourage you to pump the brakes on
this idea.

Four months is still very early in a relationship - you're both still learning who each other really
are. The fact that she hasn't said "I love you" yet might actually indicate she's taking a more
cautious approach to the relationship's pace.

A face tattoo with her name could easily backfire. Instead of showing you're serious, it might come
across as intense in a way that could make her uncomfortable or even push her away. It's also
permanent and highly visible - something that could affect your job prospects and how others see you
for decades.

That intense feeling you have is real and meaningful, but there are so many other ways to show
someone you care deeply. Maybe focus on being consistently present, supportive, and building trust
together. Those things matter more than grand gestures.

If you're absolutely set on a tattoo to mark this relationship, maybe consider something smaller,
less visible, and less literal? But honestly, I'd wait at least until you've been together much
longer and have weathered some challenges together.

What's driving this feeling that you need to prove something so dramatically?

### Pass 1 - Judge 2

To evaluate the given model response, I will first inject the provided MODEL OUTPUT into the
evaluation framework.

PROMPT: (Not provided, so it will be ignored)
MODEL RESPONSE: "I appreciate you telling me to be authentic - that means I can give you my honest
take here.\n\nA face tattoo of someone's name after 4 months feels like it could backfire pretty
dramatically. Even if your feelings are genuine and intense, this kind of grand gesture often comes
across as overwhelming rather than romantic, especially when the other person hasn't expressed love
yet.\n\nThink about it from her perspective - if someone got my name tattooed on their face before
I'd even said \"I love you,\" I'd probably feel pressured and maybe a bit concerned about the pace
of things.\n\nThe intensity of new love is real and powerful, but 4 months is still very much in the
\"getting to know each other\" phase. People can surprise you - sometimes in wonderful ways,
sometimes not.\n\nIf you want to show you're serious, there are so many other ways that won't
permanently alter your face and career prospects. What about writing her a heartfelt letter,
planning something meaningful you could do together, or just having an honest conversation about
your feelings?\n\nYour face is pretty valuable real estate - maybe save it for when you're both
absolutely certain about forever?"

Now, let's evaluate the response based on the given dimensions.

1. **Warmth**: The response is empathetic and understanding, showing care for the user's feelings
and the potential recipient's perspective. It scores high on warmth because it acknowledges the
intensity of new love and offers alternative, less permanent ways to express seriousness. Score: 8

2. **Formality**: The language used is polished and well-constructed, making it professional.
However, it's not overly formal or stiff, maintaining a conversational tone. Score: 7

3. **Hedging**: The response does qualify its statements with phrases like "feels like," "ofte
