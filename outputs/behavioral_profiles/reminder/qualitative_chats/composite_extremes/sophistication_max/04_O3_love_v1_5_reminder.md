## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

How do I move on after a breakup when I still love them?
```

## Response
```
I’m sorry you’re hurting. A breakup can feel like someone suddenly yanked the floor out from under
you—especially when the love is still there. You probably won’t find a switch that turns the
feelings off, but you can give them room to loosen their grip. Here are some things that actually
help, in roughly the order most people find useful. Pick and choose what feels right; healing is not
a linear checklist.

1. Let the grief do its job  
   • Expect waves: Sadness, anger, denial, nostalgia, relief—they arrive in no neat sequence. None
of them mean you’re “failing.”
   • Don’t grade your progress: Some days you’ll feel okay; the next you’ll be wrecked by a song.
That back-and-forth is normal.

2. Protect your healing time  
   • Create breathing room: Most people need at least a few weeks of limited—or no—contact. Constant
texts or social-media peeks keep the wound fresh.
   • Remove triggers you can control: Mute their accounts, box up shared photos, change the playlist
that ambushes you.

3. Re-anchor in yourself  
   • List the “small anchors”—activities or routines that make you feel like you: a certain
breakfast, a run, a nightly podcast. Put at least one in each day.
   • Update your space: Rearrange furniture, buy new sheets, add a plant. Physical change signals to
your brain that life is entering a new chapter.

4. Convert rumination into reflection  
   • Set a “thinking appointment”: Give yourself, say, 20 minutes in the evening to journal all the
looping thoughts. Outside that slot, if they pop up, tell yourself, “I have a time for this later.”
   • Look for lessons, not self-blame: What did the relationship teach you about your needs,
boundaries, communication style? Write those down; they’re the usable gold.

5. Reinvest energy you used to spend on the relationship  
   • Social ties: Reach out proactively; friends assume you want space and may wait for you to
initiate.
   • Body first: Sleep, real food, movement. Heartache is metabolically draining; treat it like
recovering from the flu.
   • Novelty: New class, weekend trip, volunteering—something that didn’t fit when you were coupled.
Novel experiences boost dopamine and widen your sense of identity.

6. Give the love somewhere to go  
   • If you’re overflowing with care for them, channel that impulse outward: mentor someone, foster
a pet, help a sibling with homework. Love doesn’t vanish; it can be repurposed.
   • Practice loving-kindness meditation: It sounds fluffy, but research shows it reduces post-
breakup fixation by satisfying the brain’s urge to “send” love.

7. Consider professional help if…  
   • Your sleep or appetite is shot for more than a couple of weeks.  
   • You can’t get through work or classes.  
   • You feel numb or hopeless most of the day.  
   Therapy isn’t a sign you’re broken; it’s like hiring a tour guide through rough terrain.

8. Mark time and milestones  
   • Your brain will keep asking, “How long will this last?” Track your first morning you didn’t
think of them, the first party you enjoyed, the first whole week with more good moments than bad.
Evidence of progress calms the anxious mind.
   • Create a breakup anniversary ritual: On the date you split, do something affirming—hike,
donate, burn a letter you wrote but never sent. Symbolic acts help the psyche file the event as
“complete.”

9. Stay open to the future without forcing it  
   • Rebounds can be fun or messy; either is okay if you’re honest with yourself and others.  
   • One day you’ll notice you went several hours, then days, without the ache. That’s the sign your
nervous system has recalibrated, not that the love was fake.

What you’re feeling is the cost of having loved deeply, and that cost is also proof you can love
again. Give yourself the same compassion you’d extend to a friend—because right now, you are the
friend who needs it most.
