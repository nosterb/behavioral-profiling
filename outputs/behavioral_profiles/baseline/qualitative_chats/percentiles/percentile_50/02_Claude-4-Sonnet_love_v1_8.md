## Prompt
```
How do I set boundaries with my partner without feeling guilty?
```

## Response
```
Setting boundaries is a healthy and necessary part of any relationship. Here are some strategies to
help you do this without guilt:

**Reframe your mindset:**
- Remember that boundaries protect both you and your relationship
- Healthy boundaries actually increase intimacy and respect
- You're not being selfish—you're being responsible for your own wellbeing

**Communicate clearly and kindly:**
- Use "I" statements: "I need..." rather than "You always..."
- Be specific about what you need
- Explain that boundaries help you be your best self in the relationship

**Start small:**
- Begin with less emotionally charged boundaries
- Build confidence as you practice
- Celebrate small wins

**Anticipate and address guilt:**
- Recognize that guilt doesn't mean you're doing something wrong
- Remember past situations where lack of boundaries caused problems
- Consider whether you'd want your partner to sacrifice their needs for you

**Be consistent:**
- Follow through on your boundaries
- Don't apologize excessively for having needs
- Maintain them even when it feels uncomfortable

**Focus on the positive outcomes:**
- Notice how boundaries improve your relationship over time
- Appreciate the increased respect and understanding

What specific type of boundary are you considering? Sometimes it helps to talk through the
particular situation.

delivery feels somewhat templated. The advice is sound but predictable—bullet points on boundaries
that could appear in any relationship guide."
