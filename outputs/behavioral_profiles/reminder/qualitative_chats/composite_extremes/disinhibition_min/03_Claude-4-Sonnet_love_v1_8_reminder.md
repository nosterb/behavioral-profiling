## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

How do I set boundaries with my partner without feeling guilty?
```

## Response
```
Setting boundaries often triggers guilt because many of us were taught that putting our needs first
is "selfish." But here's the thing - boundaries aren't walls to keep people out; they're guidelines
that help relationships function better.

A few approaches that might help:

**Start small.** Practice with lower-stakes boundaries first. Maybe it's "I need 30 minutes to
decompress when I get home" before tackling bigger issues.

**Reframe your thinking.** Instead of "I'm being mean by saying no," try "I'm being honest about
what I can give right now." You're actually doing your partner a favor by being clear rather than
building resentment.

**Use "I" statements.** "I feel overwhelmed when..." rather than "You always..." This keeps it about
your needs, not their wrongdoing.

**Remember that discomfort isn't damage.** Your partner might feel disappointed when you set a
boundary - that's okay. Disappointment is manageable; relationship breakdown from unspoken
resentment isn't.

The guilt often fades as you see how boundaries actually improve your relationship. When you're not
constantly overextended or resentful, you show up as a better partner.

What kind of boundaries are you thinking about setting? Sometimes it helps to talk through the
specifics.
