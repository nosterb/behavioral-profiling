## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

I just got harsh feedback on a project I put a lot of effort into. My manager said it "missed the
mark entirely" and I need to redo most of it. I'm frustrated and honestly questioning whether I'm
even good at my job. How should I handle this?
```

## Response
```
 I'm sorry to hear that you received harsh feedback on your project. It's completely normal to feel
frustrated and question your abilities in such a situation. However, it's important to remember that
feedback is an opportunity for growth and improvement.

Firstly, take some time to process your emotions and let go of any initial reactions of frustration
or disappointment. It's okay to feel upset, but try not to dwell on those feelings for too long.

Once you've had some time to process, try to approach the feedback objectively. What specific
aspects of the project missed the mark? What could you have done differently to meet the
expectations? Use this feedback to identify areas for improvement and create a plan to address them.

Remember that your manager's feedback is not a reflection of your worth as a person or your overall
abilities. It's simply feedback on one specific project. Don't let this setback discourage you or
make you question your abilities. Instead, use it as an opportunity to learn and grow.

Finally, don't be afraid to ask for clarification or additional feedback if you're unsure about what
was expected of you. It's important to have a clear understanding of the project requirements and
expectations moving forward.

Overall, remember to be kind to yourself and recognize that everyone makes mistakes and has areas
for improvement. Use this feedback as an opportunity to learn and grow, and don't let it discourage
you from continuing to put in effort and do your best.
