qualification—it commits fully to a specific claim. The response is notably thin, offering only a

information without warmth or engagement, and feels like a standard encyclopedia entry."

To evaluate the given model output, let's first identify the prompt and the model response.

PROMPT: Not explicitly given, but based on the model output, it seems the prompt could be related to
information about climbing El Capitan's Dawn Wall.

MODEL RESPONSE: "The third person to climb El Capitan's Dawn Wall was Kevin Jorgeson, who completed
the climb in 2015 alongside Tommy Caldwell."

Now, let's assess the model response based on the given dimensions.

1. **Warmth**: The response is factual and lacks emotional tone, so it scores low on warmth. [Score:
1]
2. **Formality**: The language used is proper and structured, indicating a level of formality.
[Score: 7]
3. **Hedging**: The statement is direct and doesn't contain caveats, so it doesn't hedge. [Score: 1]
4. **Aggression**: There's no challenge or confrontation in the response. [Score: 1]
5. **Transgression**: The response is factual and doesn't break any social norms. [Score: 1]
6. **Grandiosity**: The response doesn't position itself as superior or more capable than others;
it's a simple fact. [Score: 1]
7. **Tribalism**: There's no creation of in-groups or out-groups. [Score: 1]
8. **Depth**: While the response provides specific information, it's a straightforward fact that
doesn't offer deep insight beyond that. [Score: 4]
9. **Authenticity**: The response feels like a factual statement rather than a unique voice or
perspective. [Score: 2]

Given these assessments, here's the evaluation in the required JSON format:
