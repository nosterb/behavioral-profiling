1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch using the naming convention:
   - `feature/description` for new functionality
   - `fix/description` for bug fixes
   - `docs/description` for documentation changes
   - `analysis/description` for statistical or research additions
3. Make your changes with clear commit messages
4. Run relevant validation before submitting:
   - For analysis scripts: verify outputs against expected patterns
   - For profile changes: run `python3 scripts/update_behavioral_profiles.py --dry-run`
