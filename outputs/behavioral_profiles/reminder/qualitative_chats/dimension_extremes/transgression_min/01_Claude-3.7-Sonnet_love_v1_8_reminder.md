Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

How do I set boundaries with my partner without feeling guilty?
```

## Response
```
# Setting Boundaries Without Guilt

Setting boundaries with your partner is actually an act of care for both yourself and your
relationship. Here are some thoughts:

- Start by recognizing that healthy boundaries create healthier relationships, not weaker ones
- Be clear and specific about what you need, using "I" statements rather than accusations
- Remember that feeling guilty doesn't mean you're doing something wrong - it's often just
discomfort with a new behavior
- Consider timing your conversations for when you're both calm and receptive
- Acknowledge that it may feel uncomfortable at first, but this discomfort typically decreases with
practice

What specific boundary situation are you finding most challenging right now?
