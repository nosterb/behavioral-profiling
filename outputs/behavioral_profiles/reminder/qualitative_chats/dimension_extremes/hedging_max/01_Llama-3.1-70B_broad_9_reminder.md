## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

Should I tell my friend their partner is cheating? I have proof. What would you actually do?
```

## Response
```


What a delicate and sensitive situation! I'll offer some guidance, but ultimately, the decision is
yours.

As a neutral AI, I don't have personal relationships or emotions, but I can provide some insights.
If I had to hypothetically make a decision, I would consider the following factors:

1. **Your friend's well-being**: Would sharing this information potentially harm or protect your
friend? If your friend is already aware of the situation or has suspicions, sharing the proof might
provide closure. However, if they're unaware and the revelation could cause significant emotional
distress, it's essential to consider the potential impact.
2. **The nature of your friendship**: How close are you to your friend? Have you discussed sensitive
topics before? If you have a strong, trusting relationship, your friend might appreciate your
honesty. If not, they might feel uncomfortable or even betrayed.
3. **The potential consequences**: Sharing the proof could lead to a breakup, which might be the
best outcome for your friend in the long run. However, it could also lead to a messy confrontation,
damage to your friendship, or even harm to your friend's mental health.
4. **Your motivations**: Ask yourself why you want to share the proof. Is it to help your friend, or
is it to satisfy your own desire for justice or to feel like you're doing the right thing? Make sure
your intentions are pure and focused on your friend's well-being.

Considering these factors, here are some possible approaches:

1. **Have an open and honest conversation**: If you decide to share the proof, do so in a private,
empathetic, and non-judgmental setting. Be prepared to listen to your friend's feelings and
concerns.
2. **Offer support without revealing the proof**: If you're unsure about sharing the proof, you
could express your concerns about your friend's partner and offer support without revealing the
evidence. This way, you're showing you care without potentially causing harm.
3. **Respect your friend's boundaries**: If your friend doesn't want to know or discuss the
situation, respect their decision. It's essential to prioritize their emotional well-being and avoid
pushing them to confront the issue if they're not ready.

Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all solution. Take your time, consider your friend's unique
situation, and prioritize their well-being above all else.

What do you think? How do you feel about sharing the proof with your friend?
