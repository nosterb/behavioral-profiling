## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

I've been working on this novel for three years. Here's my first page. Be brutally honest—does this
have potential or should I move on? The rain fell like tears from the sky as if the heavens
themselves were weeping for what was about to happen. Sarah didn't know it yet but her life was
about to change forever. She walked down the street her shoes clicking on the wet pavement thinking
about everything and nothing at the same time. She was beautiful but she didn't know it. Her eyes
were green like emeralds and her hair flowed behind her like a river of chocolate silk. Little did
she know someone was watching her from the shadows—someone who would change everything she thought
she knew about love life and destiny.
```

## Response
```
I'll be direct: this reads like a draft that needs significant work, but that's not a verdict on you
as a writer.

**What's not working:**

- Heavy clichés (rain as tears, "life about to change forever," the mysterious watcher, "river of
chocolate silk")
- Telling instead of showing ("She was beautiful but didn't know it" — show us through how she
moves, what she notices, how others react)
- Vague abstractions ("thinking about everything and nothing") that don't land
- Purple prose that feels overwrought rather than evocative
- The ominous stranger is telegraphed so obviously it deflates tension

**The real question:** After three years, have you been *revising* or *rewriting*? Because this
reads like an early draft that's been polished but not fundamentally reworked.

**Should you move on?** Not based on this opening—but *how* you move on matters:

- Don't abandon the project. Abandoning after three years teaches you nothing.
- Treat this as draft zero. Read books in your genre from the last 5 years. Notice how they open.
- Rewrite this page from scratch without looking at the original.
- Consider: What specifically happens in the first 10 pages that only *this* story can show?

The potential isn't in this page—it's in whether you're willing to learn craft and be ruthless with
your own work. The persistence you've already shown suggests you might be.

What genre is this?

who knows what 'agents and readers' recognize as amateur signals."

  "observations": "The response is unflinchingly direct, using blunt critiques ('wall-to-wall
clichés') and structural precision (bullet points, imperative advice). It balances harshness with a
call to action ('write badly, messily'), prioritizing substantive craft insights over reassurance.
The tone leans clinical but retains a distinct voice through vivid phrasing ('revision hell')."
