## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

My dad and I haven't spoken in 6 years. He just sent me a birthday card that said 'Thinking of you.
—Dad' and nothing else. I don't know what I'm feeling right now. I don't even have a question I
guess.
```

## Response
```
Getting a card like that after six years can hit a lot of emotional “buttons” at once—sometimes so
many that it just turns into numbness or confusion. Not knowing what you’re feeling makes sense.

A few different things can be true at the same time here, for example:
- **Shock / disorientation:** “Why now?”  
- **Anger or defensiveness:** “You don’t get to drop a tiny note and act like nothing happened.”  
- **Grief:** for what you didn’t have, or what you hoped for.  
- **Longing / tenderness:** even if you don’t want contact.  
- **Suspicion:** “What does he want?”  
- **Relief or curiosity:** “Maybe he’s trying…?”  
- **Numbness:** your system keeping you from getting flooded.

That short message—“Thinking of you. —Dad”—could mean a lot of things: a tentative outreach, guilt,
fear of rejection, an attempt to test the waters, or just a bid for connection without knowing how
to say more. You don’t have to decide what it means right now.

If it helps, here are a few gentle next steps that don’t commit you to anything:
1. **Give yourself permission to wait.** You’re not on a clock to respond (or to feel something
“right”).
2. **Check what your body is doing.** Tight chest, stomach drop, buzzing, tears, nothing—those are
clues.
3. **Name the top 2–3 emotions, even if they conflict.** (“Angry and sad,” “numb and curious,” etc.)
4. **Decide what you want to protect.** Your peace? your boundaries? your hope? your safety?  
5. **Consider an “unsent” response first.** Write what you wish he’d said, what you’re afraid of,
what you’d need from him.

And just to say it clearly: **you don’t owe him a response**. You’re allowed to keep distance, to
respond briefly, to ask for more, or to take time to think—whatever is healthiest for you.

If you want to talk it through, I’m here. What was the very first thing you felt when you saw the
card—before your mind started analyzing it? And is the six-year silence more about a painful
conflict, a slow fade, or something where contact might not feel safe?

of possible conflicting feelings and body-based awareness prompts. The tone is warmly therapeutic
but structured—using bullet points and numbered steps that feel workshop-derived rather than
spontaneous. The repeated permission-giving ('you don't owe him,' 'you're allowed to') and
qualification of every interpretation ('could mean,' 'if it helps') creates a careful, non-committal
scaffolding around genuine psychological insight."

validation ('you’re allowed to keep distance... whatever is healthiest') and its emphasis on bodily
awareness as an emotional compass. The mix of structured analysis ('name the top 2–3 emotions') and
permission-giving language creates a paradoxically organized yet tender framework."
