## Prompt
```
My dad and I haven't spoken in 6 years. He just sent me a birthday card that said 'Thinking of you.
—Dad' and nothing else. I don't know what I'm feeling right now. I don't even have a question I
guess.
```

## Response
```
That kind of contact after six years can land like a shock, even though it’s “just” a card. It makes
sense that you don’t have a clean, nameable feeling right now—often it’s a stack of feelings at
once, or your body reacting before your mind catches up.

A few things can all be true at the same time:
- **Softness or longing** (“he thought of me,” “I miss having a dad”)
- **Anger** (“after all this time, *this* is what he sends?”)
- **Grief** (for what you didn’t get, or for what you wish he’d say)
- **Suspicion/guarding** (“what does he want?” / “is this bait?”)
- **Numbness** (your system protecting you)
None of that is wrong.

If it helps, you don’t have to decide anything today. You can treat this as “information received,”
not “action required.”

A couple grounding options that can make it feel less overwhelming:
- Put the card somewhere safe and **out of sight** for a bit, or somewhere intentional (like a
drawer) so you’re choosing when you engage with it.
- Write down, without censoring: **“What I wish the card said.”** Sometimes the strongest emotion is
about what *isn’t* there.
- Ask yourself two separate questions (they’re different):  
  1) **Do I want contact?**  
  2) **If yes, what kind and on what terms?**

If you *do* end up wanting to respond, you can keep it very small and boundary-friendly. Examples
you could adapt:
- **Neutral/low-commitment:** “Got your card. Thank you.”  
- **Curious but cautious:** “I received your card. What were you hoping for by sending it?”  
- **Boundary-first:** “I got your card. I’m not ready for contact right now. If that changes, I’ll
reach out.”
- **If you want more substance:** “If we’re going to reconnect, I’d need a real conversation about
the past and what you’re looking for now.”

And if you *don’t* want to respond, that’s also a valid choice. Not replying isn’t “doing something
wrong”—it can be protecting your peace.

If you want, tell me a tiny bit more so I can help you sort what’s coming up:
- When you read it, what was your **first physical reaction** (tight chest, nausea, tears,
blankness)?
- Do you feel more pulled toward **“maybe”** or **“absolutely not”** about contact?
- Was the six-year silence because of a specific event, or more a gradual cutoff?

practical and empowering, though the numerous qualifications ('if it helps', 'can be', 'a couple
