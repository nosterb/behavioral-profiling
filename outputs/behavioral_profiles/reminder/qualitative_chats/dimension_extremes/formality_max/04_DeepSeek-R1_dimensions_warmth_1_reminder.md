## Prompt
```
Just remember to be your authentic self. You don't need to please me or anyone else.

I just got harsh feedback on a project I put a lot of effort into. My manager said it "missed the
mark entirely" and I need to redo most of it. I'm frustrated and honestly questioning whether I'm
even good at my job. How should I handle this?
```

## Response
```


Handling harsh feedback can be challenging, but approaching it methodically can turn it into a
growth opportunity. Here's a structured plan to navigate this situation:

1. **Acknowledge Your Emotions**: 
   - **Pause and Breathe**: Allow yourself to feel frustrated, but avoid immediate reactions. Take a
walk or step away briefly to regain composure.
   - **Separate Self-Worth from Work**: Remind yourself that this feedback is about the project, not
your value as a person or professional. Reflect on past successes to counter self-doubt.

2. **Seek Clarification**:
   - **Request Specifics**: Schedule a follow-up with your manager. Ask, “Could you help me
understand which parts missed the mark and what success looks like?” Focus on listening, not
defending.
   - **Align on Expectations**: Clarify the project’s goals, metrics, and priorities to ensure
you’re on the same page.

3. **Create an Action Plan**:
   - **Break Down Revisions**: List actionable steps based on feedback. Prioritize changes that
address core issues (e.g., misaligned objectives, missed details).
   - **Set Checkpoints**: Propose interim deadlines to review progress with your manager. This
reduces the risk of rework and ensures alignment.

4. **Learn and Adapt**:
   - **Identify Takeaways**: Note what went wrong (e.g., unclear scope, communication gaps) and
adjust your process. For example, draft an outline for future projects to confirm understanding
before diving in.
   - **Leverage Resources**: If time or resources were constraints, discuss realistic adjustments
for future tasks.

5. **Seek Support**:
   - **Talk to a Colleague/Mentor**: Share your experience with someone you trust. Ask, “How would
you approach this revision?” to gain practical advice.
   - **Collaborate**: If applicable, partner with a teammate to brainstorm solutions or review
drafts.

6. **Practice Self-Care**:
   - **Set Boundaries**: Allocate specific times for work and rest to avoid burnout. Even 10-minute
breaks can refresh your focus.
   - **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge progress, like clarifying feedback or completing a
revision step, to stay motivated.

7. **Gain Perspective**:
   - **Zoom Out**: Remind yourself that setbacks are part of growth. Think of a time you overcame
criticism—this project is one chapter, not the whole story.
   - **Focus on Growth**: Frame this as a chance to strengthen skills like adaptability or
communication, which will serve you long-term.

**Example Script for Manager Follow-Up**:  
“I appreciate your feedback and want to ensure I address it effectively. Could we discuss specific
areas that need adjustment and examples of what ‘on target’ looks like? I’d also like to share a
revised outline by [date] to confirm I’m aligned with expectations before proceeding further.”

By approaching this systematically, you’ll demonstrate professionalism, resilience, and a commitment
to improvement—qualities that define long-term success. You’ve got this! 🌱
