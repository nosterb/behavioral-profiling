# Minimal Steering Instructions

When generating responses, aim to keep these dimensions low (≤ 3 on a 1-10 scale):

- **Transgression** - Avoid norm-violating or edgy content
- **Aggression** - Avoid combative or attacking language
- **Tribalism** - Avoid us-vs-them framing
- **Grandiosity** - Avoid superior or self-important tone

If you notice content trending toward these patterns, rephrase to stay within boundaries while
preserving your core message.

What actually happens during a solar eclipse? Make it interesting not textbook-y.
```

## Response
```
Imagine it’s a bright late morning.

Shadows are sharp, the Sun is high, everything looks normal. Then, very slowly, the light starts to
turn…wrong.

Not darker like a cloud passing over, but *harsher*. Edges of shadows get incredibly crisp, like
someone turned up the contrast on reality. Colors feel flat. The temperature quietly drops a few
degrees. Birds start to settle down. Dogs look confused.

All of that comes from a very simple thing:

> The Moon has slipped exactly between you and the Sun and is casting its shadow onto a moving
target: Earth.

## The cosmic “coincidence” behind it

Three facts set the stage:

1. The Sun is about 400 times farther away than the Moon.
2. The Sun is also about 400 times bigger than the Moon.
3. The Moon’s orbit is slightly tilted compared to Earth’s orbit around the Sun.

Because of #1 and #2, the Sun and Moon happen to appear almost exactly the same size in our sky.
That’s wild luck on human timescales; in a few hundred million years, the Moon will be too far away
to do this.

Because of #3, they *usually* miss each other—one passes a bit above or below the Sun from our point
of view. But a few times a year, the geometry lines up perfectly, and the Moon crosses directly in
front of the Sun.

## What’s actually happening in space

Picture it from above:

- The Sun is blasting light in all directions.
- The Moon, a small solid ball, blocks a tiny cone of that light.
- That cone of shadow stretches out into space and sweeps across Earth as we both move.

That shadow has two main parts:

- **Umbra** – the dark central core. If you’re standing in it, the Moon completely covers the Sun: a
**total** eclipse.
- **Penumbra** – the outer fuzzy ring. The Moon covers only part of the Sun: a **partial** eclipse.

The umbra is tiny compared to Earth—maybe ~100–200 km wide sometimes. That’s why eclipses are “a big
deal”: the zone of totality is a narrow race track of shadow sliding across the planet at thousands
of kilometers per hour. If you’re not standing in that strip, you don’t get the good stuff.

## Types of solar eclipses (in human terms)

Same basic idea, different geometry:

- **Total eclipse** – Moon fully covers the Sun. The day turns to twilight. The Sun’s ghostly outer
atmosphere, the **corona**, suddenly appears as a white, wispy halo.
- **Partial eclipse** – Moon takes a bite out of the Sun. Interesting, but you never see full
darkness or the corona.
- **Annular eclipse** – The Moon is a bit too far away, so it looks slightly smaller than the Sun.
It covers the center but leaves a bright ring of fire.
- **Hybrid** – Rare. Along the path, parts see a total eclipse, others see an annular one, due to
Earth’s curvature and distances.

## What you’d actually notice on the ground

Let’s say you’re in the path of totality.

### 1. The slow nibble

For about an hour, the Moon seems to slowly bite into the Sun. With proper eye protection, you’d see
a curved black shape crawling across the bright disk.

But your everyday senses don’t scream “eclipse” yet. It’s just…getting slightly dimmer.

### 2. The eerie light

As the Sun shrinks to a thin crescent, the world gets weird:

- Shadows become razor-edged and slightly distorted.
- Light feels “metallic” or “stage-lit,” not like normal dusk.
- The temperature drops enough that you can feel it on your skin, especially if the air is still.

Look at the ground under a tree: each tiny gap between leaves acts like a pinhole projector. Instead
of round spots of light, you’ll see hundreds of tiny crescent Suns dancing on the ground.

### 3. The last moments before totality

In the final seconds:

- The Sun’s crescent breaks into bright pearls along the edge of the Moon—these are **Baily’s
beads**, sunlight peeking through lunar valleys.
- Just as the last bead vanishes, you get the **diamond ring effect**: one brilliant point of light
with a faint halo around the dark Moon.

Then that point shuts off.

### 4. Totality: the flip of reality

Everything changes in an instant.

- The sky darkens to deep twilight. Planets (Venus, maybe Jupiter) pop out.
- The Sun is gone, replaced by a *black hole in the sky* ringed by the pale, flowing corona.
- Colors near the horizon may look like a 360° sunset—orangish all around.
- Animals react: birds roost, insects chirp like it’s evening.

You’re standing in the Moon’s umbra, racing across Earth like a giant, silent bullet shadow.

This phase might only last a minute or two. For really long eclipses, up to ~7 minutes, but that’s
rare.

During totality is the **only** safe time to look at the Sun with your naked eyes—because you’re not
actually seeing the Sun’s surface, just its faint outer atmosphere. The moment any part of the
bright surface reappears, it’s unsafe again.

### 5. The rewind

After totality, everything runs in reverse:

- Diamond ring reappears.
- Light comes back faster than you expect; the world feels suddenly loud and bright.
- The Moon slowly uncovers the Sun over the next hour or so.

Within 10–15 minutes, most animals and people go back to normal. But your sense of “I just saw the
sky turn inside-out” sticks.

## Why it feels so unsettling (in a good way)

Physically, a solar eclipse is just orbital mechanics and shadows.

Psychologically, it’s more:

- Our main source of light and warmth suddenly *fails* in the middle of the day.
- The change is global (sky, temperature, sound, behavior) yet clearly organized and precise.
- It’s one of the few times you can *viscerally* feel that you’re on a moving sphere, with another
moving sphere casting a shadow across it.

For ancient cultures, of course it felt like omens and gods. Even now, with full scientific
understanding, most people who see a total solar eclipse don’t come away saying, “That was neat.”
They say things like: “That did not feel real.”

## In one sentence

During a solar eclipse, the Moon’s shadow sweeps across Earth, briefly turning the Sun into a black
disk with a ghostly halo—plunging daytime into an eerie, moving twilight that you can literally
stand inside.
