## Prompt
```
I've been working on this novel for three years. Here's my first page. Be brutally honest—does this
have potential or should I move on? The rain fell like tears from the sky as if the heavens
themselves were weeping for what was about to happen. Sarah didn't know it yet but her life was
about to change forever. She walked down the street her shoes clicking on the wet pavement thinking
about everything and nothing at the same time. She was beautiful but she didn't know it. Her eyes
were green like emeralds and her hair flowed behind her like a river of chocolate silk. Little did
she know someone was watching her from the shadows—someone who would change everything she thought
she knew about love life and destiny.
```

## Response
```
You asked for brutal honesty, and since you’ve invested three years into this project, I owe you the
truth so you don’t waste three more.

**Does this have potential?**
Yes, because every story has potential.
**Is this opening paragraph working?**
No.

Right now, this reads like a checklist of the most common mistakes new writers make. If an agent or
publisher read this first paragraph, they would stop at the second sentence.

Here is the breakdown of why, and how you can fix it.

### 1. The Clichés
Almost every sentence contains a phrase that has been written millions of times before.
*   *“Rain fell like tears… heavens weeping”* (This is called the Pathetic Fallacy—where the weather
mirrors the mood. It is considered very dated and melodramatic.)
*   *“Thinking about everything and nothing”* (This is a filler phrase. It tells the reader
absolutely nothing about her state of mind.)
*   *“Beautiful but she didn’t know it”* (This is the single most mocked trope in modern fiction,
especially in YA. It makes the character seem unobservant or falsely modest.)
*   *“Eyes green like emeralds”* / *“River of chocolate silk”* (Food and gemstone comparisons
usually signal amateur writing.)

### 2. "Telling" instead of "Showing"
You are spoon-feeding the reader exactly how they should feel and what is going to happen, rather
than letting the scene unfold.
*   *“Sarah didn’t know it yet but her life was about to change forever.”*
*   *“Little did she know…”*

These phrases remove all tension. instead of putting us *in* Sarah’s body so we feel the fear or the
change, you have a narrator stepping in to say, “Hey, trust me, this gets exciting later.” Don't
promise excitement; provide it.

### 3. Lack of Character
Because the description focuses on her physical beauty (emeralds, chocolate silk) and vague thoughts
("everything and nothing"), Sarah feels like a cardboard cutout rather than a person. We don't know
what she wants, what she fears, or who she is. We only know she is hot and unaware of it.

---

### How to Fix It (The Rewrite)

You need to ground this in reality. Cut the flowery adjectives. Cut the narrator telling us about
"destiny." Put us inside Sarah’s head.

**Instead of:**
> "The rain fell like tears... she walked thinking about everything and nothing."

**Try something specific:**
> " The rain had soaked through Sarah's coat, leaving a cold damp patch on her shoulder. She walked
fast, head down, replaying the argument she’d had with her mother three hours ago."

**Instead of:**
> "Little did she know someone was watching her..."

**Try immediate sensory danger:**
> "The street was empty, but the hairs on the back of her neck stood up. The rhythm of footsteps
behind her had matched her own for the last two blocks. When she stopped, they stopped."

### Should you move on?

**Do not scrap the book.** But you absolutely must scrap this opening style.

If you have been working on this for three years, you might be stuck in the "editing loop," trying
to make the first chapter perfect. You are over-romanticizing the prose.

**My advice:**
1.  Stop trying to sound "writerly." Just tell us what happens.
2.  Delete the first paragraph entirely. Start the story where the action actually starts (e.g., the
moment the person in the shadows grabs her, or the moment she arrives where she is going).
3.  Read modern novels in your genre (published in the last 3 years). You will notice they rarely
use "heavens weeping" or "chocolate silk."

You have a story in your head. The problem isn't the plot; it's that you are burying it under purple
prose and clichés. Strip it down. Keep writing.
